			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Scams aren’t what they used to be. These days, AI can write perfect emails, mimic voices, and even fake a video call so well you’d swear you were talking to the real person. The problem is, the timing of a scam can be just right when you’re distracted, busy, or looking for exactly what they’re offering. That’s when even the most careful person can get caught.</p> <p dir="ltr">My guest, Ritesh Kotak, knows this world inside and out. He’s a cybersecurity analyst, an Ontario lawyer, and a tech innovator who’s worked with Fortune 500 companies and served in policing, where he helped start one of Canada’s first municipal cybercrime units. He’s got a BBA, MBA, and JD, all focused on privacy, cybercrime, and the way emerging tech impacts everyday life.</p> <p dir="ltr">In our conversation, Ritesh explains how criminals are using AI as a weapon, how it can also be a shield, and why simple, low-tech steps, like having a secret phrase with family or confirming a request through a different channel, are still some of the best defenses. He even shares a close call he had himself, which is a good reminder that nobody’s immune when scams are this convincing.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Show Notes:</h3> <ul> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[00:50] Ritesh shares his background as a lawyer helping clients navigate AI, tech, and cybercrime.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[01:18] His fascination with technology began at age three after taking apart his father’s computer.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[03:59] In policing, Ritesh saw early signs of cybercrime blending with physical crime.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[06:55] He demonstrates cybersecurity risks by live hacking a police chief, leading to the creation of a cybercrime unit.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[09:16] A near-miss phishing scam involving discounted amusement park tickets highlights how timing plays a role.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[15:14] Spoofed calls and evolving scam tactics make detection harder despite telecom safeguards.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[17:09] Ritesh explains AI as both a sword for criminals and a shield for protection.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[20:00] Generative AI enables flawless phishing emails, fake websites, and realistic deepfake audio and video.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[28:00] Simple defenses like secret phrases and multi-channel verification can stop many scams.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[31:45] Reporting scams to police can help investigations and sometimes recover funds.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[33:17] Ritesh advocates for centralized fraud response centers to improve victim support.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[36:45] Calling a lawyer can help victims navigate legal and civil remedies.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[38:05] Final advice: pause, verify, and use low-tech habits to prevent high-tech crime.</li> </ul> <p dir="ltr">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Most of us think of scams as random or isolated or something that just happens to unlucky people. But what if the truth is far more organized, far more disturbing? Behind many of today’s scams is a global web of criminal enterprises, structured like corporations and fueled by technology, data, and billions of stolen dollars.</p> <p dir="ltr">In this episode, we sit down with Ken Westbrook. Ken spent over three decades in the CIA before retiring, only to return to the fight after his own mother was targeted and lost most of her life savings to a tech support scam. That moment changed everything. He founded Stop Scams Alliance, a nonprofit on a mission to stop scams before they ever reach our devices. His approach? Building bridges between tech companies, banks, telecom, government, and consumer advocates to cut these criminal operations off at the source.</p> <p dir="ltr">Ken brings a rare blend of intel experience and personal urgency to this issue. He breaks down what’s really going on behind the scenes, why the U.S. is falling behind in this fight, and how other countries are pushing back effectively.

But according to Brian Davis, effective fraud defense is just as much about people, trust, and communication as it is about tools and data.

He’s seen firsthand how fraudsters adapt quickly, and how internal misalignment or a lack of education can leave companies vulnerable. His layered approach focuses on understanding how business systems are abused and using that knowledge to design smarter defenses.</p> <p dir="ltr">In this episode, Brian shares his journey into the fraud space, explains why internal politics often matter more than policy, and offers a real-world breakdown of how fraud teams can gain traction and build trust.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">What if your social media success was built on deception, and it was working? In today’s episode, we hear from someone who knows exactly how that happens. Tim O’Hearn is a former software engineer and the author of Framed: A Villain’s Perspective on Social Media, a book that pulls back the curtain on how follower factories, automation, and persuasive technologies have shaped the online world we now take for granted. Tim doesn’t just theorize, he built these systems himself.</p> <p dir="ltr">Tim walks us through how his small side gig growing Instagram accounts evolved into a lucrative business, one that constantly navigated the blurry line between innovation and breaking platform rules. He opens up about the clever strategies he used to avoid detection and psychological hooks that made these methods so effective, as we explore the deeper consequences of social media’s addictive nature. </p> <p dir="ltr">We’ll also explore the hidden risks businesses and individuals face when they obsess over metrics and follower counts instead of genuine connections, and why most people don’t even realize they're caught up in this trap.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">What if your social media success was built on deception, and it was working? In today’s episode, we hear from someone who knows exactly how that happens. Tim O’Hearn is a former software engineer and the author of Framed: A Villain’s Perspective on Social Media, a book that pulls back the curtain on how follower factories, automation, and persuasive technologies have shaped the online world we now take for granted. Tim doesn’t just theorize, he built these systems himself.</p> <p dir="ltr">Tim walks us through how his small side gig growing Instagram accounts evolved into a lucrative business, one that constantly navigated the blurry line between innovation and breaking platform rules. He opens up about the clever strategies he used to avoid detection and psychological hooks that made these methods so effective, as we explore the deeper consequences of social media’s addictive nature. </p> <p dir="ltr">We’ll also explore the hidden risks businesses and individuals face when they obsess over metrics and follower counts instead of genuine connections, and why most people don’t even realize they're caught up in this trap.  Whether you're running a business, casually browsing, or just trying to figure out the complicated world of online attention, this conversation will give you a rare peek behind the curtain. And as you’ll find out, stepping away from it all might not be as straightforward as you'd think.</p> Show Notes: <ul> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[01:12] Tim recently published Framed: A Villain's Perspective on Social Media, a book that shares his journey from breaking the rules on social media to getting millions of followers for his clients.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[02:15] We learn a little bit more about the beginnings of spamming the Internet and increasing online presence, including MySpace and Instagram, which evolved into getting more followers.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[04:14] This created social proof and the possibility of higher conversion rates.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[05:09] Increasing followers using botnets or fake followers.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">What happens when the drive to succeed masks deep emotional wounds and addiction? In this episode, Jonathan Schwartz shares a powerful and painfully honest account of how his life unraveled. </p> <p dir="ltr">Once one of Hollywood’s most trusted financial advisors, Jonathan worked with icons like Beyoncé, Mariah Carey, and Gwyneth Paltrow. On the surface, he had it all. But underneath the success was a secret struggle with gambling and drug addiction that led him to steal millions from the very clients who trusted him most. </p> <p dir="ltr">His fall from grace was dramatic and public, ending in a prison sentence and the loss of everything he had built. But that wasn’t the end of his story. Today, Jonathan is sober and rebuilding his life with purpose. As Program Director at Altus Rehab, he now helps others find their own way out of addiction and shame. His story is raw, real, and full of hard-earned wisdom for anyone who has ever felt like they couldn’t ask for help.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Show Notes:</h3> <ul> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[01:30] Jonathan is a different person from who he was. He grew up in Upstate New York and his father left when he was four. His mom had a lot of stress and took it out on him which created childhood trauma.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[03:34] Accounting was the subject that he was good at.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[05:02] Eventually, his cousin gave him a job working in Los Angeles for celebrities.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[06:33] In 2004, he became a partner in GSO business management. He got a break when Linkin Park was looking for someone in business management. Their success opened up the floodgates.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[08:37] He began getting more and more A-list clients.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[09:04] In 2010, he became addicted to gambling.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[10:01] This eventually led to embezzlement from his celebrity clients. He placed the bet with this bookie everyday for 6 years.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[13:48] He ended up embezzling about 7 million dollars.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[14:12] When he stopped gambling he had suicidal ideation.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[17:05] He always intended to pay the money back.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[19:37] Jonathan shares a time when the bank wanted to call Alanis. </li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[21:03] There was a point when his partners started to notice something wasn't right.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[22:04] In 2015 he was fired by Alanis, but he continued to give his attention to his A-list clients.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[24:42] He didn't want to expose anyone to the fact that he was committing crime. He never told a soul.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[25:07] The dark secret was eating him inside, and he also had to deal with his unresolved trauma.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[27:12] How Jonathan had to come clean with his wife, because he was scheduled for a lie detector test.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[28:48] After failing the test, he was facing 23 years in prison. He negotiated a four to six year plea agreement.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[31:14] He ended up being released early because of COVID.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[32:11] He struggled to get a job and ended up going back to school, and now he's a marriage and family therapist with an emphasis on addiction and trauma.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[34:00] In prison he had the opportunity to reflect on his bad decisions and read a lot of books.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[36:33] He's proud to be sober and a nerd.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">What happens when the drive to succeed masks deep emotional wounds and addiction? In this episode, Jonathan Schwartz shares a powerful and painfully honest account of how his life unraveled. </p> <p dir="ltr">Once one of Hollywood’s most trusted financial advisors, Jonathan worked with icons like Beyoncé, Mariah Carey, and Gwyneth Paltrow. On the surface, he had it all. But underneath the success was a secret struggle with gambling and drug addiction that led him to steal millions from the very clients who trusted him most. </p> <p dir="ltr">His fall from grace was dramatic and public, ending in a prison sentence and the loss of everything he had built. But that wasn’t the end of his story. Today, Jonathan is sober and rebuilding his life with purpose. As Program Director at Altus Rehab, he now helps others find their own way out of addiction and shame. His story is raw, real, and full of hard-earned wisdom for anyone who has ever felt like they couldn’t ask for help.</p> Show Notes: <ul> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[01:30] Jonathan is a different person from who he was. He grew up in Upstate New York and his father left when he was four. His mom had a lot of stress and took it out on him which created childhood trauma.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[03:34] Accounting was the subject that he was good at.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[05:02] Eventually, his cousin gave him a job working in Los Angeles for celebrities.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[06:33] In 2004, he became a partner in GSO business management. He got a break when Linkin Park was looking for someone in business management. Their success opened up the floodgates.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[08:37] He began getting more and more A-list clients.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[09:04] In 2010, he became addicted to gambling.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[10:01] This eventually led to embezzlement from his celebrity clients. He placed the bet with this bookie everyday for 6 years.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[13:48] He ended up embezzling about 7 million dollars.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[14:12] When he stopped gambling he had suicidal ideation.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[17:05] He always intended to pay the money back.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[19:37] Jonathan shares a time when the bank wanted to call Alanis. </li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[21:03] There was a point when his partners started to notice something wasn't right.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[22:04] In 2015 he was fired by Alanis, but he continued to give his attention to his A-list clients.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[24:42] He didn't want to expose anyone to the fact that he was committing crime. He never told a soul.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[25:07] The dark secret was eating him inside, and he also had to deal with his unresolved trauma.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[27:12] How Jonathan had to come clean with his wife, because he was scheduled for a lie detector test.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[28:48] After failing the test, he was facing 23 years in prison. He negotiated a four to six year plea agreement.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[31:14] He ended up being released early because of COVID.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[32:11] He struggled to get a job and ended up going back to school, and now he's a marriage and family therapist with an emphasis on addiction and trauma.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[34:00] In prison he had the opportunity to reflect on his bad decisions and read a lot of books.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[36:33] He's proud to be sober and a nerd. His trauma is resolved, and he gets to help people in treatment not make the same mistakes that he made.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[41:34] Celebrities today need to understand not to trust their business manager so quickly and to make sure that they're proactive in their financial affairs and that they're asking for source documents.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[42:11] Audit your business manager with some level of frequency.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[48:43] Don't go out and spend all your money. Treat your first dollars as your last dollars.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[50:56] Jonathan has a book coming out in about 12 months.</li> </ul> <p dir="ltr">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">People used to think fraud was something that happened in the shadows, rare, distant, and mostly affecting big companies. But after talking to PJ Rohall, it’s clear that fraud is evolving fast, and it’s showing up in places most of us don’t even think to look.</p> <p dir="ltr">In this episode, I sit down with PJ Rohall, Head of Fraud Strategy and Education at SEON and co-founder of About Fraud. PJ’s work is all about staying ahead of scammers and helping businesses and individuals understand how fraud actually works. From synthetic identities and AI-powered scams to account takeovers and refund fraud, he breaks it all down in a way that’s both eye-opening and surprisingly accessible.</p> <p dir="ltr">We talk about how fraudsters think, what makes people vulnerable, and why collaboration is one of the best defenses we have. PJ shares practical tips, real-world examples, and some of the patterns he’s seeing that everyone should be aware of.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Scammers aren’t just phishing your inbox anymore—they’re impersonating your voice, your face, and even your coworkers. Deep fakes and social engineering have moved beyond clever tricks and become powerful tools that bad actors are using to infiltrate businesses, breach accounts, and dismantle trust at scale. What used to take a hacker hours and expensive tools can now be done in minutes by anyone with a Wi-Fi connection and a little malicious intent.</p> <p dir="ltr">Our guest today is Aaron Painter, CEO of Nametag, a company leading the charge in next-generation identity verification. Aaron’s background includes 14 years at Microsoft and executive roles in cloud tech across Europe and Asia. After witnessing firsthand how easily identity theft could unravel lives—especially during the shift to remote everything—he founded Nametag to answer a critical question: how can we know who’s really behind the screen? With Nametag, Aaron is building real-time, high-security ID checks that are already reshaping how help desks and businesses protect users.</p> <p dir="ltr">In this conversation, we unpack the difference between authentication and identity, why traditional methods like security questions are dangerously outdated, and how mobile tech and biometrics are changing the game.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Cyber warfare is no longer something that happens behind closed doors or in some far-off digital corner. It's happening now—and reshaping the rules of conflict in real time. Drone strikes controlled by apps, ransomware attacks on hospitals—today's battleground is just as likely to be online as on the ground. That science fiction scenario is now a critical, constant threat-the kind that affects us all globally.</p> <p dir="ltr">I'm really excited to introduce you to Dr. Chase Cunningham. He's a retired Navy chief cryptologist with a wealth of experience in cyber operations for the NSA, CIA, FBI—and more. He's the one who pioneered zero-trust security strategies and advises top decision-makers in government and private industry. That gives him a front-row seat to how digital warfare is evolving—and what that means for all of us. He's also the author of Cyber Warfare and the gAbriel Series, where his real-world expertise comes to life in stories that are chillingly plausible.</p> <p dir="ltr">We talk about how cyber conflict is already playing out in Ukraine, how different threat actors operate—and why critical infrastructure is such a tempting target. Chase shares practical advice on what individuals and small businesses can do to better protect themselves. We also look at what governments are doing to defend against these growing threats.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Scammers are getting smarter, understanding the psychology behind social engineering and the challenges companies face every day can help keep networks secure. This episode will show how to anticipate these threats and secure networks against ever-changing vulnerabilities. We’ll focus on practical, real-world solutions to protect data and trust.</p> <p dir="ltr">Dr. Jared Smith joins us to share his insights from his role leading research and development at SecurityScorecard. He also co-founded UnCat, a B2B accounting technology company serving thousands of customers and teaches as an adjunct professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and NYU. His experience shows why social engineering is so effective and how companies can adapt to a world where attackers are always refining their techniques.</p> <p dir="ltr">This episode shows how even small oversights or minor issues can lead to big breaches. Dr. Smith shares concrete steps to strengthen defenses, and why we need both technical solutions and employee awareness. By looking at the psychology behind the attacks, he’ll show that staying one step ahead depends on using smart security tools and a culture that recognizes vigilance at every level.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Show Notes:</h3> <ul> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[01:19] Jared is a distinguished thought researcher at SecurityScorecard. He's built systems and helps vendors monitor and secure their networks. He also has a PHD in computer science. He focuses on Border Gateway Protocol or BGP. </li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[02:16] He was also a high clearance government national security researcher.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[03:02] Jared shares a story about how sophisticated phishing scams are becoming.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[08:43] How large language models are making more sophisticated social engineering possible.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[10:26] The importance of thinking about cybersecurity needed in the next 10 years.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[11:02] BGP is like the plumbing of the internet. BGP poisoning breaks the typical internet traffic route. It's very nuanced traffic engineering that uses the Border Gateway Protocol.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[13:34] BGP is also useful when you have multiple internet connections and one goes down.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[14:20] The most sophisticated DDoS works are called link flooding attacks, where they identify links that have a certain amount of bandwidth, and they flood that specific border gateway protocol link, effectively segmenting the internet in those places.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[15:39] Managing DDOS attacks and where the traffic comes from.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[16:02] Being aware of botnets, because they are what's rented out or being used for these attacks.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[17:32] Lizard Squad launched DDoS as a service. </li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[21:00] Attackers try to get the actual IP addresses from behind a CDN.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[23:41] How AWS has the ability to manage large amounts of traffic.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[25:24] There are some DDoS that just require sending enough traffic to fill up the buffers on the other side of the application.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[28:15] The size of a botnet for DDoS to take down a big network like X.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Scammers are getting smarter, understanding the psychology behind social engineering and the challenges companies face every day can help keep networks secure. This episode will show how to anticipate these threats and secure networks against ever-changing vulnerabilities. We’ll focus on practical, real-world solutions to protect data and trust.</p> <p dir="ltr">Dr. Jared Smith joins us to share his insights from his role leading research and development at SecurityScorecard. He also co-founded UnCat, a B2B accounting technology company serving thousands of customers and teaches as an adjunct professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and NYU. His experience shows why social engineering is so effective and how companies can adapt to a world where attackers are always refining their techniques.</p> <p dir="ltr">This episode shows how even small oversights or minor issues can lead to big breaches. Dr. Smith shares concrete steps to strengthen defenses, and why we need both technical solutions and employee awareness. By looking at the psychology behind the attacks, he’ll show that staying one step ahead depends on using smart security tools and a culture that recognizes vigilance at every level.</p> Show Notes: <ul> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[01:19] Jared is a distinguished thought researcher at SecurityScorecard. He's built systems and helps vendors monitor and secure their networks. He also has a PHD in computer science. He focuses on Border Gateway Protocol or BGP. </li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[02:16] He was also a high clearance government national security researcher.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[03:02] Jared shares a story about how sophisticated phishing scams are becoming.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[08:43] How large language models are making more sophisticated social engineering possible.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[10:26] The importance of thinking about cybersecurity needed in the next 10 years.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[11:02] BGP is like the plumbing of the internet. BGP poisoning breaks the typical internet traffic route. It's very nuanced traffic engineering that uses the Border Gateway Protocol.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[13:34] BGP is also useful when you have multiple internet connections and one goes down.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[14:20] The most sophisticated DDoS works are called link flooding attacks, where they identify links that have a certain amount of bandwidth, and they flood that specific border gateway protocol link, effectively segmenting the internet in those places.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[15:39] Managing DDOS attacks and where the traffic comes from.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[16:02] Being aware of botnets, because they are what's rented out or being used for these attacks.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[17:32] Lizard Squad launched DDoS as a service. </li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[21:00] Attackers try to get the actual IP addresses from behind a CDN.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[23:41] How AWS has the ability to manage large amounts of traffic.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[25:24] There are some DDoS that just require sending enough traffic to fill up the buffers on the other side of the application.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[28:15] The size of a botnet for DDoS to take down a big network like X.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">What makes someone betray their country? It’s rarely just about money. In this episode, you’ll hear from a retired CIA officer who spent 25 years recruiting foreign spies by tapping into something deeper than greed. Jim Lawler shares real stories from his career in human intelligence, where persuasion was built on empathy, trust, and understanding what truly drives people.</p> <p dir="ltr">From failed pitches to high-stakes successes, he explains the psychology behind espionage, how personal stress becomes a powerful leverage point, and why most people who commit treason believe they’ve been betrayed first.</p> <p dir="ltr">Whether you’re curious about spycraft or just want a better grasp of human behavior, this conversation pulls back the curtain on how people can be influenced to cross the line.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Show Notes:</h3> <ul> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[00:50] Jim was a CIA operations officer. His job was to recruit foreign spies for the CIA.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[01:21] Most of his career was about battling weapons of mass destruction. His specialty was human intelligence and recruiting foreign spies was the backbone of that.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[02:32] He's now a speaker and a teacher. He's also written three spy novels.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[03:02] MICE Framework: Money, Ideology, Coercion, and Ego.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[05:11] Jim shares a story from one of his first recruitment pitches. He also found out that revenge is a driving force for espionage.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[11:58] Polygraph tests are stress detectors.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[15:16] Divorce is one of the most psychologically tumultuous times in a person's life. When recruiting, Jim would become their best friend because he never once recruited a happy person.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[16:07] He would study the crack system like a rock climber. He was a keen listener and very curious. </li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[17:33] Empathy and patience were everything when recruiting spies.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[20:21] Jim talks about the metaphysics, which is like a neural link where he would put out what he would envision as an invisible link to the brain of his recruits.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[22:11] If something is too good to be true it is.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[23:45] As a recruiter, he had to manipulate, exploit, and subvert people to get them to do what he wanted them to do.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[27:58] Jim believes in treating people the way he would like to be treated.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">What makes someone betray their country? It’s rarely just about money. In this episode, you’ll hear from a retired CIA officer who spent 25 years recruiting foreign spies by tapping into something deeper than greed. Jim Lawler shares real stories from his career in human intelligence, where persuasion was built on empathy, trust, and understanding what truly drives people.</p> <p dir="ltr">From failed pitches to high-stakes successes, he explains the psychology behind espionage, how personal stress becomes a powerful leverage point, and why most people who commit treason believe they’ve been betrayed first.</p> <p dir="ltr">Whether you’re curious about spycraft or just want a better grasp of human behavior, this conversation pulls back the curtain on how people can be influenced to cross the line.</p> Show Notes: <ul> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[00:50] Jim was a CIA operations officer. His job was to recruit foreign spies for the CIA.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[01:21] Most of his career was about battling weapons of mass destruction. His specialty was human intelligence and recruiting foreign spies was the backbone of that.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[02:32] He's now a speaker and a teacher. He's also written three spy novels.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[03:02] MICE Framework: Money, Ideology, Coercion, and Ego.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[05:11] Jim shares a story from one of his first recruitment pitches. He also found out that revenge is a driving force for espionage.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[11:58] Polygraph tests are stress detectors.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[15:16] Divorce is one of the most psychologically tumultuous times in a person's life. When recruiting, Jim would become their best friend because he never once recruited a happy person.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[16:07] He would study the crack system like a rock climber. He was a keen listener and very curious. </li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[17:33] Empathy and patience were everything when recruiting spies.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[20:21] Jim talks about the metaphysics, which is like a neural link where he would put out what he would envision as an invisible link to the brain of his recruits.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[22:11] If something is too good to be true it is.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[23:45] As a recruiter, he had to manipulate, exploit, and subvert people to get them to do what he wanted them to do.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[27:58] Jim believes in treating people the way he would like to be treated. He was sincere with his actions.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[28:35] He believes in using his powers of persuasion for good.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[32:43] Over 90% of the people he pitched became assets.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[33:48] Jim explains what a cold pitch is and the objective to get the second meeting. </li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[36:58] His novels are thinly based on operations he did.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to cybersecurity, most people think about firewalls, passwords, and antivirus software. But what about the attackers themselves? Understanding how they operate is just as important as having the right defenses in place. That’s where Paul Reid comes in.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Ever had that creepy feeling someone's watching you online? Now imagine if that feeling was actually your reality, not just your browsing history being tracked, but cameras following your every move on the street, your conversations being monitored, your payments scrutinized. For our guest Josh Summers, this wasn't some dystopian nightmare, it was his daily life.</p> <p dir="ltr">Josh isn't your typical privacy advocate. As the creator behind All Things Secured (both a website and YouTube channel), his passion for digital privacy was forged through nearly 20 years living abroad, much of it in China. There, he didn't just read about surveillance, he lived under its shadow, using VPNs to bypass censorship and experiencing the gut-wrenching moment of being detained and questioned by Chinese authorities.</p> <p dir="ltr">In our revealing conversation, Josh pulls back the curtain on what government surveillance actually feels like from the inside. He shares how these experiences transformed a personal survival strategy into a mission to help others protect themselves in our increasingly watched world.</p> <p dir="ltr">We dive into how surveillance actually works from those eerily accurate facial recognition systems to the GPS tracking that follows your every move, and the countless ways big companies turn your personal information into profit. Josh not only makes us aware of potential problems, he offers real-world solutions that balance security with the convenience we all crave.</p> <p dir="ltr">With Josh's guidance, we discover surprisingly simple ways to shield our digital lives from encrypted messaging apps that keep conversations private, virtual credit cards that protect your finances, and alternative mailing addresses that safeguard your physical location. He also reveals the hidden dangers lurking in those so-called smart devices scattered throughout your home, and explains why privacy matters even if you think you have nothing to hide.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Show Notes:</h3> <ul> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[00:34] Josh is the host of All Things Secured. He wants to help people become a hacker's worst nightmare.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[01:30] Josh, his wife, and children lived in China. There was censorship and social platforms were blocked. </li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[02:05] He began using VPNs. Over the decade there, every type of surveillance was used.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[03:34] He had a travel site and walked around with a camera.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[04:03] In 2018 he was detained by the government. It was scary and he realized the rights he was giving up when traveling to other countries.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[05:53] He was kicked out of China, and became more conscious of the pervasive mass surveillance.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[08:40] He was severely outmatched with the psychological tricks of the interrogators.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[12:57] Even if surveillance is legal, that doesn't make it ethical. </li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[13:18] Small consistent steps towards privacy will make us less of a target.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[14:25] Josh talks about ways that we are being monitored from cameras to facial recognition. Digital currencies track what we purchase.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[17:04] Facebook has so many files on us.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Ever had that creepy feeling someone's watching you online? Now imagine if that feeling was actually your reality, not just your browsing history being tracked, but cameras following your every move on the street, your conversations being monitored, your payments scrutinized. For our guest Josh Summers, this wasn't some dystopian nightmare, it was his daily life.</p> <p dir="ltr">Josh isn't your typical privacy advocate. As the creator behind All Things Secured (both a website and YouTube channel), his passion for digital privacy was forged through nearly 20 years living abroad, much of it in China. There, he didn't just read about surveillance, he lived under its shadow, using VPNs to bypass censorship and experiencing the gut-wrenching moment of being detained and questioned by Chinese authorities.</p> <p dir="ltr">In our revealing conversation, Josh pulls back the curtain on what government surveillance actually feels like from the inside. He shares how these experiences transformed a personal survival strategy into a mission to help others protect themselves in our increasingly watched world.</p> <p dir="ltr">We dive into how surveillance actually works from those eerily accurate facial recognition systems to the GPS tracking that follows your every move, and the countless ways big companies turn your personal information into profit. Josh not only makes us aware of potential problems, he offers real-world solutions that balance security with the convenience we all crave.</p> <p dir="ltr">With Josh's guidance, we discover surprisingly simple ways to shield our digital lives from encrypted messaging apps that keep conversations private, virtual credit cards that protect your finances, and alternative mailing addresses that safeguard your physical location. He also reveals the hidden dangers lurking in those so-called smart devices scattered throughout your home, and explains why privacy matters even if you think you have nothing to hide.</p> Show Notes: <ul> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[00:34] Josh is the host of All Things Secured. He wants to help people become a hacker's worst nightmare.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[01:30] Josh, his wife, and children lived in China. There was censorship and social platforms were blocked. </li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[02:05] He began using VPNs. Over the decade there, every type of surveillance was used.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[03:34] He had a travel site and walked around with a camera.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[04:03] In 2018 he was detained by the government. It was scary and he realized the rights he was giving up when traveling to other countries.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[05:53] He was kicked out of China, and became more conscious of the pervasive mass surveillance.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[08:40] He was severely outmatched with the psychological tricks of the interrogators.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[12:57] Even if surveillance is legal, that doesn't make it ethical. </li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[13:18] Small consistent steps towards privacy will make us less of a target.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[14:25] Josh talks about ways that we are being monitored from cameras to facial recognition. Digital currencies track what we purchase.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[17:04] Facebook has so many files on us. Being tracked online adds up.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[21:07] There are ways to build a privacy moat around your digital life and still stay in contact with friends and family.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[22:27] Steps for practical privacy include being careful about how you share data, encrypted alternatives, and use masking services to reduce your digital footprint.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">In a world where data is more important than ever, understanding how it is acquired, shared, and misused is critical. Data brokers work behind the scenes, amassing enormous amounts of personal information from online activity, loyalty programs, and even public records, often without the users' knowledge. This data powers targeted marketing, scams, and even identity theft. But what can be done to regain control of personal privacy? Today we're diving deep into this topic with cybersecurity expert Darius Belejevas, who has spent years assisting folks in removing their data from these digital marketplaces. He is the head of Incogni and Surfshark. </p> <p dir="ltr">In this chat, Darius is going to share how these sneaky data brokers operate. He'll break down why it's such a big deal when our data gets out there for all to see, and he'll arm us with some solid strategies to keep our privacy intact. We’ll also look at practical tactics that everyone can apply to limit their exposure to hackers. We’ll discuss data sharing, using privacy-focused products, and understanding legislation like GDPR and CCPA.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Getting defrauded is common. It happens everywhere but it’s underreported because of embarrassment. If you’re a victim of fraud the sooner you report the more likely you are to get a better outcome.</p> <p dir="ltr">To learn more about fraud I’m pleased to welcome Marc Evans, a seasoned financial crimes detective and co-founder of Fraud Hero, who has spent over a decade investigating fraud schemes that affect everyday people. With expertise in social engineering, money laundering and credit card scams he has spent his career uncovering the ways criminals use to exploit victims. His passion for fraud prevention comes not only from his investigative experience but also from his personal experience of identity theft which almost derailed his entry into law enforcement. Through his work Marc has recovered millions of dollars for victims and trained thousands of people on how to recognize and prevent fraud before it happens.</p> <p dir="ltr">In this episode Marc lifts the lid on the evolving world of financial fraud, revealing the most common scams and the sophisticated tactics criminals use to stay one step ahead of their victims. From bank imposters to phishing scams and CEO fraud he breaks down how these crimes work, why they are so effective and how law enforcement is trying to disrupt them. He also shares practical steps individuals and businesses can take to protect themselves including monitoring of financial accounts, reporting fraud quickly and using digital security tools.</p> <p dir="ltr">Beyond his law enforcement career Marc’s passion for fraud prevention extends into his entrepreneurial venture Fraud Hero where he educates the public on how to protect themselves from financial deception. He believes knowledge is power and has developed resources to help individuals secure themselves personally and financially. As fraud continues to rise with criminals getting more resourceful and brazen, Marc's mission remains the same – to empower people to be their own first line of defence.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Show Notes:</h3> <ul> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[01:10] Marc is a fraud and financial crimes detective.

We also need to realize that even if we have cybersecurity experts get hacked, there is no reason to feel embarrassed or ashamed when it happens to us. In today’s show we’re going deep into the world of cybersecurity with one of the industry’s most seasoned experts, Sam Curry.

But cybersecurity isn’t just about firewalls and encryption—it’s about mindset. Sam joins us to talk about the hacker mentality, zero-trust security and why even the best security professionals get hacked. </p> <p dir="ltr">From his early days in cryptography to mitigating major cyber breaches Sam shares his insights on how businesses and individuals can defend themselves in a digital world.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The CISO role is constantly changing. With all the shifts in cybersecurity, it's crucial to find ways to attract new talent to close the growing skills gap. CISOs now juggle complex systems managed at multiple levels and handle burnout amongst many other responsibilities.</p> <p dir="ltr">Today's guest is Jill Knesek. Jill is the Chief Information Security Officer for Blackline, a company that does financial SaaS solutions. It’s based out of the Los Angeles area. She’s been there almost three years now as the CISO, running the information security team.</p> <p dir="ltr">She previously served as Chief Security Officer for BT Global Services.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Data is continuously being collected and this information can lead to misleading conclusions about an individual. Without proper context, behavior can be misinterpreted. This underscores the need for data privacy laws and stronger protections against data brokers.</p> <p dir="ltr">Today’s guest is Jeff Jockisch. Jeff is a passionate data privacy researcher dedicated to exploring the evolution of technology, our search behaviors, trust dynamics, and safeguarding of our information. As Managing Partner at ObscureIQ, he specializes in advanced data removal and privacy risk mitigation for enterprises and government organizations.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Show Notes:</h3> <ul> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[0:58] - Jeff describes his career and what he does in the field at ObscureIQ.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[3:35] - Instead of taking his career into the compliance field, he took his expertise to the intersection of data privacy and data science.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[4:40] - Jeff explains what a data broker does and breaks down a recent data breach.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[5:40] - The legal definition of what a data broker is is very narrow.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[6:42] - The data that is collected by data brokers can literally be anything, like health care data, drivers licenses, and viewing habits online.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[7:32] - One of the worst types of data that is collected is cell phone location data.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[8:46] - Data tells a story, but pieces might be missing. Data can paint an inaccurate picture of someone.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[10:18] - Data can be interpreted in different ways.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[12:41] - Your digital footprint can be deleted.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Cybersecurity is more crucial than ever. It’s essential that we proactively safeguard our data and recognize that no one is immune to attacks. We are all vulnerable. As malicious actors continually enhance their tactics, we must stay one step ahead by consistently improving our defenses.</p> <p dir="ltr">Today’s guest is Vincent LaRocca. Vincent is the CEO of CyberSecOp with the commitment to protecting sensitive data and mitigating cyber threats. With over two decades of experience, Vincent has successfully steered CyberSecOp to become one of the world’s fastest growing managed security providers, specializing in cybersecurity assessments, breach management, and risk management consulting.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Show Notes:</h3> <ul> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[1:15] - Vincent shares his background and how he found himself working in cybersecurity.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[2:40] - Even the experts are vulnerable. Vincent shares an experience he had with fraud at his bank.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[4:16] - Cyber threat trends are moving to AI.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[6:19] - As consumers, we need to be aware of how AI is using our data and what we give it permission to have access to.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[8:19] - AI isn’t going anywhere. It will continue to grow and develop.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[9:16] - Threat actors are unfortunately usually one step ahead of defenses.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Now that so much of our communications are digital, such as texts, emails, and chats, we miss out on the tone and facial expressions to help us understand the intent and content in communication.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">It’s not always easy to determine the value of digital assets. The potential of overestimating or undervaluing your data can make it difficult to establish how much protection you need for a cyber intrusion. </p> <p dir="ltr">Today’s guest is Jeremiah Grossman. Jeremiah has spent over 25 years as an InfoSec professional and hacker. He is the Managing Director of Grossman Ventures. He is an industry creator and founder of White Hat Security and Bit Discovery. He has his black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and is an avid car collector.</p> <h3 dir="ltr">Show Notes:</h3> <ul> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[0:53] - Jeremiah shares his background and what he does as the managing director of new venture capital, Grossman Venture.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[1:55] - When he was 24, Jeremiah’s business was victimized by a data breach.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[5:30] - This experience taught him that if you treat your customers with integrity and have their best interests in mind, they will keep doing business with you.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[7:43] - These things happen to countless businesses. It is important to keep customers and clients informed.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[10:27] - Cybercrime is one of the only crimes where the victim doesn’t always know they’re a victim.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[13:30] - When it comes to solving these problems, we have to narrow in on the problems that are worth solving and then work for a solution.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[14:53] - Doing an asset evaluation is a good starting point.

It’s important to know where this information is stored and what would happen if that software was hacked or you weren’t able to access it. Today’s guest is Kris Burkhardt.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Moving money has never been easier. We no longer need to go into a bank, fill out a slip, and hand it to a teller to receive our money. We can now transfer money instantly. Scammers are taking advantage of unfamiliar technology to either hack in and take our money or to deceive you into sending it to them yourself. Deciding if the bank is responsible for the loss is becoming more and more of a conversation.</p> <p dir="ltr">Today’s guest is Uri Rivner. Uri has been fighting financial crime for 20 years working closely with the world’s largest banks on developing strategies against online fraud and scams. Prior to founding Refine Intelligence, Uri was co-founder and Chief Cyber Officer at BioCatch, the global leader in behavioral biometrics for fraud detection. Earlier, Uri served as Head of New Technologies at RSA.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Moving money has never been easier. We no longer need to go into a bank, fill out a slip, and hand it to a teller to receive our money. We can now transfer money instantly. Scammers are taking advantage of unfamiliar technology to either hack in and take our money or to deceive you into sending it to them yourself. Deciding if the bank is responsible for the loss is becoming more and more of a conversation.</p> <p dir="ltr">Today’s guest is Uri Rivner. Uri has been fighting financial crime for 20 years working closely with the world’s largest banks on developing strategies against online fraud and scams. Prior to founding Refine Intelligence, Uri was co-founder and Chief Cyber Officer at BioCatch, the global leader in behavioral biometrics for fraud detection. Earlier, Uri served as Head of New Technologies at RSA. Innovations Uri spearheaded, such as risk-based authentication, are now saving the industry billions of dollars each year in fraud. </p> Show Notes: <ul> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[1:19] - Uri shares his background in fighting fraud for the last 20 years.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[3:43] - The companies Uri has worked for, founded, and co-founded work with banks and financial institutions to help protect against fraud.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[5:10] - In a fraud situation, people are tricked through social engineering to hand over their information, but the fraudsters move the money.</li> <li dir="ltr" role="presentation">[6:41] - Fraud is unauthorized.

He is ranked among the top 1% of highly cited social scientists worldwide and has published over 150 research papers.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Our home IoT devices are constantly being probed for weaknesses so that they can be compromised and used for broader nefarious purposes like cyber warfare.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Today’s guest is Bryan Seely, a world famous cyber security expert, ethical hacker, author, keynote speaker, and former US Marine. He is known for intercepting calls to the US Secret Service and FBI. We chat about why and how he did it and surprisingly why he didn’t go to jail.</p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">[0:48] - Bryan shares his background, what he does now, and what he is famous for.</p> </li> <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">[2:10] - To show how easily hacked and manipulated Google Maps was, Bryan changed the names of locations which didn’t get their attention.</p> </li> <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"> <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">[4:03] - At the time, the FBI didn’t know that Bryan wiretapped them.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">After being scammed, embarrassment can prevent people from getting the help they need, but in order to destigmatize the painful mistake, more people need to report incidents and understand that it happens to even the most technically savvy. </p> <p dir="ltr">Today’s guest is Rory Innes. Rory has spent his entire career in cybersecurity and has worked for leading global cybersecurity companies in a range of senior management positions.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We like to think that we’re too smart to be taken advantage of by a scammer, but some are willing to invest a tremendous amount of time and effort for a payout. Many do not come forward because of the fear, shame, and victim-blaming, but that’s not true with today’s guest.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Ayleen Charlotte. Ayleen was one of the women featured in the Netflix documentary The Tinder Swindler. She made a radical choice between victimhood or becoming a beacon of female empowerment. After what became five years of misery, she decided not only to tell her story, but to make a lifelong entrepreneurial dream come true.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:20] - When Ayleen contacted, there were already other women victimized, but Ayleen was a big part of the Tinder Swindler’s arrest.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:49] - She had three goals that participating in the documentary helped achieve.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:27] - Ayleen met this scammer five years ago and started a relationship with him.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:19] - Because he claimed to have many enemies, he moved in with Ayleen and used her money and credit cards to “stay under the radar.”</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:58] - The lavish lifestyle he lived made sense with the story he provided to the women he victimized.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[8:15] - One indicator that something was wrong was that money given back to her in the form of a check would never go through.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:40] - He always had an operation to start and Ayleen took several personal loans to help with these endeavors.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:27] - He laid a foundation of trust with the small things.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:15] - Ayleen says that in the beginning, he really made her feel special. The development of the relationship was going well and very believable.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:18] - There is a big difference between this situation and other types of fraud, as there was a real relationship built.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:15] - The Tinder Swindler used the same stories over and over again with every victim.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:08] - Even when he had “interactions” with enemies, he would show up with real injuries.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:15] - Some of the people on his team did not know they were part of this, although Ayleen says his bodyguard and his right-hand were aware.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:51] - An article was released about him and Ayleen saw it and immediately knew.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:18] - Ayleen lists some of the reasons he gave for the article being released. In this instance, Ayleen trusted the article over him.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:43] - When he continued to ask for money, Ayleen was in contact with the police. She wound up tricking him and, in a way, taking some of her money back.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:58] - If Ayleen didn’t give him money, he made it clear that she would be in danger from his enemies.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:18] - If someone is asking you for money and trying to push you, take a step back, shut down your phone, and think about it for a few days.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:38] - Over time, Ayleen saw a change in character, especially when she stopped sending him money.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:44] - The Tinder Swindler started his fraud schemes at the age of 15 and did not only target women. He swindled men as well as organizations and charities.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:26] - He is not able to get a real job or career at this point. This is the only thing he can do and he will continue. He is still out there, living in Israel.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[33:50] - The documentary has helped in slowing his scam.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[35:39] - Ayleen’s trust of other people has not been impacted. She knows that she has experienced the worst already.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[37:29] - Ayleen says the best thing you can do in a situation like this is to talk about it.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millions have been impacted by data breaches. Many of us know how fraudsters work and how they utilize this information. But our parents and children become victims because of their fear or urgency inflicted by the scammers. Today’s guest is Mike Cook.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With AI having the ability to search the internet and write a paper, create an image, or even a video having someone say what they didn’t say, we can no longer use the phrase that seeing is believing. Today’s guest is Peter Sisson. As a serial entrepreneur with a master’s in AI from Stanford, Peter is working to fight fake news, fake reviews, and fake products. Misinformation and polarization have exploded since Peter began his career in Silicon Valley more than 20 years ago and his latest company CertifyIt offers an app that can help stop it.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:08] - Peter shares his background in AI and as a serial entrepreneur.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:01] - We believe what we see and it is already getting hard to determine what is real.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:38] - The biggest concern is faking videos and faking images is already happening.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:04] - The technology isn’t there yet and usually you can tell when an image or video is fabricated.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:55] - AI has been trained by the entire internet. AI can write anything you want it to, but none of it is original.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:18] - AI doesn’t actually know anything. It uses what is already available to learn patterns. Peter explains how it works.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:25] - There are a lot of ethical concerns about using AI to create content.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:51] - News providers use CertifyIt to know that content they release is accurate before they break fake news.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:08] - Peter shares the story of CNN breaking news that wasn’t true but really appeared to be accurate.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:16] - How does CertifyIt use metadata to confirm accuracy?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:07] - Chris and Peter discuss some examples of how people need to use CertifyIt, which is a public benefit corporation.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:01] - It is a simple concept, but it works and is a viable solution to ensure content is accurate.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:25] - The sooner the video is determined to be true, it is news that can be broken faster.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:46] - Fake reviews are a big problem right now where people are even hired to write them for companies or products.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:21] - Certified location videos could be beneficial for certain products or services.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:50] - A third party like CertifyIt is necessary as people won’t believe the vetting if it’s done by the news organization.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:16] - You can trick people’s brains pretty easily as we are designed to believe what we see. This is especially easy if the viewer is tired or distracted.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[31:50] - The more people get fooled, the more they will need a tool to vet the accuracy of a video they view.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[33:29] - There will be false positives and false negatives as the technology gets better and better.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[35:54] - The things that AI can create are truly very cool and can be entertaining, but the way people use it will change and probably not for the greater good.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[38:21] - It will be possible to create alternate realities that are very convincing.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[39:23] - It will probably take something major happening to bring this problem to light for the general public.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[41:03] - The CertifyIt app can be used in a multitude of ways to provide a sense of confidence that the content you are viewing is true.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

I started the Easy Prey Podcast with the goal of helping listeners learn to avoid being an easy target for scammers and fraudsters, both online and in the real world. Since the first episode on March 18, 2020, I’ve had the honor of interviewing some of the most influential people in their fields. We’ve talked about topics ranging from personal safety, self-defense, social engineering, and romance scams, to phishing, cybercrime, and everything in between. This episode is a slightly different format than normal. We’ve had some amazing guests on the show over the last 149 episodes.

Peter is a former police detective and Director of Fraud Management for major UK companies. Ten years ago he set up his own consultancy and has established a reputation as “The Fraud Guy” specializing in research, training, and investigation around organized crime.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[0:50] - Peter shares his background and why he’s known as The Fraud Guy.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:10] - Throughout his career, Peter spoke with former cybercriminals and hackers.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:51] - Cybercriminals are applying advanced business techniques to their organizations.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:40] - What gets ignored is what cybercriminals and former criminals can tell us.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:46] - We know that cybercriminals can watch what we’re doing, but what we don’t think about is that we can do the same to them.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[8:49] - The first function of these organized cybercrime gangs is to steal data. Next is to buy and enhance the data. And the third is to cash out.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:50] - There are some exceptions to the rule.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:50] - The purpose of creating false identities has changed over the years.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:53] - The biggest advantage that cybercriminals have is they get things done, while the good guys abide by time-consuming policies.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:14] - Peter feels like the “good guys” need advice on how to help this problematic trend.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:28] - The more sophisticated areas of cybercrime, the more elitist are actually a small portion. The largest portion of cybercrime is actually several years old.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:11] - Peter shares an example of how organized cybercrime has impacted corporations as well and the rise of check fraud.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:07] - The common Nigerian prince scam still works! </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:13] - Guilt and fear are commonly triggered emotions.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:03] - Another reason the Nigerian prince scam works is the trigger of a victim’s ego.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:36] - The use of bots and automated messaging can hit so many people at one time with very little effort.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:50] - Talk to the people who are important to you that may not be aware of these scams. Just because we know it, doesn’t mean they do.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:56] - Millennials are now the highest target age bracket of those being targeted by scams.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:40] - Cybercriminals reach a point of success where it’s no longer about the money. It’s about their ego.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[36:00] - We have to understand the difference in lifestyle and how cybercriminals recruit more people.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[37:43] - There is little to no support for scam victims and in many countries there are no laws stating that this is even illegal.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[40:18] - What role does machine learning play?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[43:01] - Peter shares some experiences in changing up his spending habits.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[45:12] - There are many different types of ways to access data that Peter lists here.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[46:52] - There is a lot more going on before, during, and after every single transaction, especially those done online.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[48:59] - Peter initially got into fraud because of an increase in the apparent theft of thousands of vehicles.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[50:20] - Insurance fraud is also a very common problem.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[52:53] - Obligatory security is a form of protection that could be a solution to many problems.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[54:08] - Peter is optimistic about the future of cybersecurity.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[55:35] - If we can decrease the money taken by cybercriminals through fraud, the money can be used for better things.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[57:56] - There are some varying opinions on the politics of scams.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[59:49] - Many scammers are in the industry out of desperation.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[61:35] - We can’t continue to be in a world where this industry grows.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand that hackers look for weaknesses in networks to manipulate or take data, but understanding the ways that vehicles can also be accessed either remotely or physically can be a bit surprising.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Derrick Thiecke. Derrick works as an Embedded Systems Security Tester in the automotive industry where he found himself after spending over a decade in the corporate IT world. When Derrick isn’t data dumping ROM chips, scouring through vehicle log data, or fuzzing CAN networks, he can be found as a brief blur passing by you on the highway.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[0:58] - Derrick shares his background and current role as a security tester for automotive controllers and devices.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:30] - There are differences between vehicle networks and home networks.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scammers are brilliant at targeting the vulnerable and then often using the fear of exposure to extort even more out of them.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking to our aging parents about their finances can be a tough conversation. But there are ways to educate and protect our parents from being taken advantage of by scammers, charities, and other organizations without being seen as controlling or overstepping. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Cameron Huddleston. Cameron is an author, speaker, and award-winning financial journalist. She’s the Director of Education and Content at Careful, the first service built to protect and monitor aging adults’ daily finances. Cameron’s work has appeared in a number of publications including Forbes and The Chicago Tribune.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:09] - Cameron described the experience of caring for her mother with alzheimers. She had not had a conversation with her about her finances.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:37] - Talking to your parents about scammers is a way to open the door to more conversation about finances.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:13] - Warn your parents about red flags because there’s no way you can keep them updated on every single scam.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:29] - As we age, we all experience some level of cognitive decline.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:38] - Get an idea of how they are doing now so that you will be more aware of changes.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[8:56] - You’re not trying to pry or be nosey. This is a series of conversations that open the door to communication about finances for the future.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:00] - Older adults are more likely to be exploited by someone they know.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:10] - Nothing has to happen right now except the beginnings of conversations. Cameron lists some things to have in order later.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:07] - There are things you can do to help prevent a caretaker from taking advantage of your parents.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:35] - There are some red flags to listen for in conversations with your aging parents and/or their caretaker.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:43] - If you are concerned about your parent’s credit or finances, you can have their credit frozen and you can monitor everything for safety.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:58] - Your parents can also sign up for services while they are healthy and add you to the monitoring account for notifications.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:39] - Cameron shares an experience with her own mother. She was a giving person but with her alzheimers, she wound up donating money frequently.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:51] - How can you help them get the spending on charity donations under control?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:21] - One piece of advice for parents is to let all calls go to voicemail and don’t call the numbers they called from.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:21] - Chris describes an unusual and suspicious new text scam.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instinct to respond immediately to incorrect, negative, or hurtful comments online almost seems to be hardwired. How we respond can lead to unintended detrimental consequences and lead us down a dark path. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Dr. Robin Kowalski. Dr. Kowalski is a professor of Psychology at Clemson University. She obtained her PhD in Social Psychology from the University of North Carolina Greensboro. Her research interests focus primarily on adverse interpersonal behaviors, most notably complaining, teasing, and bullying with a particular focus on cyberbullying. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[0:57] - Welcome to the show, Dr. Kowalski!

Cyberbullying is similar but there are some differences.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:24] - Perceived anonymity in the online world gives bullies a great deal of power.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:42] - People who are involved in traditional bullying tend to also participate in cyberbullying.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:05] - There are many different reasons why someone bullies another either traditionally or virtually.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:18] - In the virtual world, anyone can be a victim and anyone can be a perpetrator.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:31] - Cyberbullying can take several different forms.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:56] - If it happens once, simply walk away and don’t respond. But what happens if it keeps happening?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:10] - Young people may not want to be honest with their parents out of fear that their technology might be taken away from them.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:29] - The feelings involved with cyberbullying range from anxiety to suicidal ideation.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:22] - Academic issues become a problem as well, even though cyberbullying takes place off of school grounds.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:58] - Robin describes “mattering” and how this can impact youth in school.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:38] - Social isolation is a warning sign for a lot of things. Parents need to be on the lookout and open up lines of communication.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:40] - Anonymous reporting needs to be present, effective, and people need to be educated.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:51] - Cyberbullying is not limited to youth. It happens in the workplace as well.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:47] - Through Covid-19, prevalence rates did not change as much as Robin expected.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:15] - If we receive something negative, Robin advises to pause before responding emotionally.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:55] - There’s such a familiarity with technology that it has become normalized to cyberbullying.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:57] - Suicide is a possible and horrible result of cyberbullying.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[35:05] - There’s a more permanent feeling to cyberbullying.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[36:32] - Employers can also search for evidence of behavior patterns in potential employees.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[38:57] - Education is key and victims speaking out about their experience helps people understand the impact.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[41:42] - Robin shares about a time she experienced some level of cyberbullying.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can understanding someone’s digital footprint really make it easier for it to predict what they’ll be doing using AI? Today’s guest is Daniel Hulme. Daniel has a PhD in Computational Complexity and works in the field of AI, applied technology, and ethics. He is the CEO and founder of Satalia, a Tedx speaker, and educator at Singularity University. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[0:50] - Daniel has already been interested in how humans behave and describes how he got into AI.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:05] - AI gets grouped into technology but there are a lot of different types of AI.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:50] - The ultimate goal of AI is to have computers make decisions and learn from the decisions, but that’s not commonplace right now.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:31] - Someone’s digital footprint can be used to learn a lot about them.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:51] - The challenges that we are facing with AI are not ethical challenges, they are safety issues.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[8:29] - AI is super complex and is becoming more difficult to test.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:03] - AI’s learning isn’t usually the problem. It’s the framework put in place.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:36] - Machine learning is a generalization of the world which can create biases.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:26] - Building explainable systems is incredibly important.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:20] - Daniel gives an example of how AI can use data but why human decisions are still important.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:16] - It’s much more cost effective to have simple solutions than complex ones.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:35] - What is the effect of building a super intelligence?

He posts tech videos about rare and retro tech, new tech, and even has a series about scammy tech products. Whether you are a tech whiz or a beginner, it doesn’t matter.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All security is personal. It’s important for each individual to understand the risk of predators so we can protect ourselves, our data, and our finances. Today’s guest is Robert Siciliano. Robert is a security expert and private investigator, number 1 Amazon best-selling author of five books, and an architect of the CSI Protection Certification, a cyber-social identity and personal protection security awareness training program. He is a frequent speaker and media commentator and the CEO of Safr.me. Robert has been featured on CNN, Fox News, and in The Wall Street Journal.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:02] - Robert shares his background and career, beginning with self-defense training in the 90’s.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:40] - At the start, Robert operated his business through a catalog and through live training. Once he offered credit card payments, he was hacked.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:58] - There will always be a criminal element out there looking for a target.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:01] - All security is personal, including both physical and virtual.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:55] - Chris shares an experience of owning an online bookstore.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:32] - Regardless of the value, there are people who are motivated to steal anything.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:27] - Some people have the mentality that they don’t have anything valuable to steal. Humans are born with the innate ability to trust.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:31] - It is also human nature to lie.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:52] - It is getting easier and easier for people to make fake social media profiles that are very believable.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:52] - Every time someone reaches out to you, be suspicious.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are addressing the blindspots in your online security, you cannot prevent the costly impact of lost or hacked data. Today’s guest is Ralph Russo. Ralph retired from the New York Police Department after over 20 years and served as the commanding officer of an organized crime control task force of local, state, and federal law enforcement. He is currently the Director of Tulane University’s School of Professional Advanced Information Technology where he has taught in both homeland security and information technology programs.

Today’s guest is Stuart Madnick. Professor Madnick has been a faculty member at MIT since 1972. He has served as the head of MIT’s IT group for more than 20 years. During that time, the group has been consistently rated number 1 in the nation among schools for information technology programs.

			<description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is easy for people to create fake online profiles and say or do whatever they want as a cyberbully. They often don’t think through the possible consequences of their actions. Today’s guest is Tina Meier. Tina is the Executive Director of The Megan Meier Foundation. Her life was forever changed on October 16, 2006 when Tina’s 13 year old daughter Megan Taylor Meier took her own life after being cyberbullied by an adult neighbor posing as a fictitious boy named Josh Evans. Her belief is that if there is even just one child that struggles with bullying, cyberbullying, or self-harm, that is one too many and we must be there to help and support them.</span> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:08] - Megan struggled with self-worth and self-esteem.

It turned out that it was a fake account created by the neighbor.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:03] - It is hard to fathom that an adult was behind this, however Tina does not believe that Megan would take her own life.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[8:27] - The FBI investigated and determined who was behind the fake account.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:50] - The court case was a first of its kind and Tina explains the process and results.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:15] - Tina took her focus to beginning the Megan Meier Foundation to help other kids.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:34] - In the early 2000s, there were really no restrictions or laws in place to help protect people.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:02] - When your child is young, talk to them about the rules and make sure they understand.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:32] - For adolescents, share stories like Megan’s story.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:20] - Who will your child feel comfortable coming to in a time of crisis?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:15] - Be aware of behavior changes.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:21] - Check in with teachers and school staff to see if behavior changes take place at school, too.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:24] - Listen to your child and validate their feelings. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:45] - There’s the concern of the other party knowing you’ve taken a screenshot.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When buying from Amazon, you might think that all products come directly from the manufacturer to Amazon warehouses. But that is not always the case. Learn how to spot potential counterfeit products and protect yourself and your brand on Amazon. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is David Cooper. David is the CEO and founder of IPSecure, which is an innovative new way to protect your intellectual property on Amazon, control your sales channel, and ensure every purchase of your product on Amazon is a positive and reputable shopping experience. He has spent 20 years building and deploying brand protection solutions for hundreds of global brands such as the NFL, J&J, Apple, and Rolex.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:00] - David shares his background and information on his company IPSecure.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:02] - eCommerce is huge, but is still only a fraction of the size of total retail.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:42] - Solutions in this space are almost always legal.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:35] - Finding counterfeiters has no impact but companies tend to measure how many are found. IPSecure measures everyone.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:28] - You can’t quantify how much risk was avoided.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:01] - When a counterfeiter is taken down, more pop up. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:30] - Brand protection is something David advises to add for customers.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:12] - There are some universal signs of counterfeit products, but there are also some signs that are specific to Amazon.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:43] - Amazon has a specific algorithm that chooses who sees what products. Check the store’s profile.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:32] - It is easy to be deceived on a marketplace site. David illustrates this with a Samsung camera purchase that was a parallel import.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:42] - There is nothing wrong with buying and reselling something, but there is a gray market problem.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:21] - These legal solutions are very expensive.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:02] - Amazon is proactive in some areas, but generally speaking, they do not monitor products belonging to specific brands.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:16] - For most brands, selling on Amazon is necessary.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:19] - Even if a brand pulls out of Amazon, their products are likely still being sold on Amazon and that could be a liability.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:49] - Instead of focusing on taking down other profiles and sellers, IPSecure focuses on building your own brand to be a successful one.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:45] - While challenging, Amazon does more than any other company to help brands with this concern.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:32] - People are much more aware of these concerns as Amazon has grown.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[34:18] - Congress is taking a look at how Amazon runs, but there have been many distractions from these issues with the current world climate.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[34:19] - It is very complex with a lot of moving parts.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When buying from Amazon, you might think that all products come directly from the manufacturer to Amazon warehouses. But that is not always the case. Learn how to spot potential counterfeit products and protect yourself and your brand on Amazon. </p> <p>Today’s guest is David Cooper. David is the CEO and founder of IPSecure, which is an innovative new way to protect your intellectual property on Amazon, control your sales channel, and ensure every purchase of your product on Amazon is a positive and reputable shopping experience. He has spent 20 years building and deploying brand protection solutions for hundreds of global brands such as the NFL, J&J, Apple, and Rolex.</p> Show Notes: <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[1:00] - David shares his background and information on his company IPSecure.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[3:02] - eCommerce is huge, but is still only a fraction of the size of total retail.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[4:42] - Solutions in this space are almost always legal.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[6:35] - Finding counterfeiters has no impact but companies tend to measure how many are found. IPSecure measures everyone.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[9:28] - You can’t quantify how much risk was avoided.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[11:01] - When a counterfeiter is taken down, more pop up. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[12:30] - Brand protection is something David advises to add for customers.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[14:12] - There are some universal signs of counterfeit products, but there are also some signs that are specific to Amazon.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[15:43] - Amazon has a specific algorithm that chooses who sees what products. Check the store’s profile.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[17:32] - It is easy to be deceived on a marketplace site. David illustrates this with a Samsung camera purchase that was a parallel import.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[19:42] - There is nothing wrong with buying and reselling something, but there is a gray market problem.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[21:21] - These legal solutions are very expensive.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[23:02] - Amazon is proactive in some areas, but generally speaking, they do not monitor products belonging to specific brands.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[24:16] - For most brands, selling on Amazon is necessary.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[25:19] - Even if a brand pulls out of Amazon, their products are likely still being sold on Amazon and that could be a liability.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[28:49] - Instead of focusing on taking down other profiles and sellers, IPSecure focuses on building your own brand to be a successful one.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[30:45] - While challenging, Amazon does more than any other company to help brands with this concern.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[32:32] - People are much more aware of these concerns as Amazon has grown.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[34:18] - Congress is taking a look at how Amazon runs, but there have been many distractions from these issues with the current world climate.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[34:19] - It is very complex with a lot of moving parts. IPSecure integrates well with a lot of different platforms.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[37:52] - Smaller businesses cannot afford to lose a sale to a counterfeiter and likely cannot hire a lawyer.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">[40:41] - David shares the story of a client whose business exploded after their product was on a reality show.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are living in a world where AI can do many of the things people have been doing, thus creating an opportunity for us to create and do something new. Not understanding this transition can leave us unnecessarily exposed to risk. Today’s guest is Howard Getson. Howard is the President and CEO at Capitalogix. He runs an algorithm hedge fund and the data science company that powers it.

			<description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Too often people seek training after they’ve had an encounter or violent situation. Criminals look to exploit us for one thing that we all possess. Listen on to find out what that is. Today’s guest is Tim Larkin. Tim is the founder and creator of Target Focus Training and is well known for self-defense and close combat training. During the last 20 years, he has trained not only law enforcement, the US Navy Seals, Army Special Forces, and the US Border Patrol, but also corporate clientele from around the world. He is an author and a public speaker in over 40 countries. </span> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[0:52] - Tim describes his background and how he found himself passionate about combat and combat training.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:43] - Initially, Tim’s goal was to become a Navy Seal.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:39] - Tim’s eardrum was busted during a dive with the Navy Seals, and he lost control of his body.

You can watch the video</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tmxq5G9D_Ik"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:49] - Behavior with your phone becomes second nature.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:04] - We spend our downtime on the smartphone, but Tim always keeps one ear out.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:03] - There are tons of positives about smartphone technology, but in public, it can be used against you.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:46] - Tim shows how to detect a possible predator with a personal anecdote.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:41] - We can’t pick out predators. It is impossible to tell as they blend in.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:15] - Tim interacts with everyone assuming they are violent to ensure safety.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[33:26] - As a society, we can get away with a lot of different types of social interactions, but anything you do or say can trigger someone else.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[35:33] - If you understand the predator's role, everything is backed up by the possibility of violence.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[38:10] - Highly recommended is Robert Green’s book</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law of Human Nature</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[39:59] - Study human behavior and you’ll learn about others and yourself.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[42:00] - When is it okay to use the tool of violence? When you are devoid of choice.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[43:15] - Women tend to me more in tuned to non-verbal cues than men.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[44:36] - The more you learn about human nature, you have these tools you can reference.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[46:10] - Tim gives some examples of when violence is the answer.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[48:29] - When your life's on the line, you need to have tools at the ready.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[50:03] - There are parts of the body that you simply cannot protect. The goal is to take the brain out of the equation.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[52:00] - For criminals, violence is their currency.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[53:51] - Tim explains what cause state is.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[56:12] - Your brain is incredible and if you give it permission, it will solve problems.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would it shock you to know that over 1 million children under the age of 9 have had their identity stolen in the last year alone? It is important to be aware of how this can happen and what you need to do to prevent it from happening to your children. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Kelli Grant. Kelli is currently Senior Editor at CNBC and was the Senior Consumer Reporter at Marketwatch and Smart Money. Kelli has earned the certified financial planner designation which recognizes financial advisors who meet education, experience, and ethics requirements, and have passed tough industry exams. Her work has appeared in the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Kipplinger’s Personal Finance, Good Housekeeping, Family Circle, and other publications. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:15] - Kelli shares her background and expertise in the field. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:07] - What is the difference between identity theft and fraud?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:12] - Identity theft of children happens mostly through forms and paper.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:56] - In some cases, organizations that need private information in records don’t know how to manage it safely.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:38] - In many cases, organizations that ask for a Social Security Number don’t even need it.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once someone is emotionally invested in purchasing a new pet, it’s easier to be manipulated and defrauded. We want to share ways that you can be sure not to get scammed. Today’s guest is Jack Whittaker. Jack is a PhD candidate in Criminology with published works in the field of online fraud. He has presented at several fraud conferences as well as has done expert interviews for both national and international news outlets. Jack also helps run a voluntary counter fraud initiative called PetScams.com and occasionally teaches cybercrime awareness to school children.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:04] - Jack shares how he became involved with PetScams.com.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:00] - Pet scams are very unique to certain countries including the United States.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:25] - Pet scams originally come from Cameroon. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:46] - An offender will create a website and set up Google ads. They spend tons of money to start this sometimes with stolen cards and reinvestment.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:56] - There are fake sites listed on Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest to generate more traffic.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:59] - Victims of these scams tend to be people who are very vulnerable.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:32] - After the victim pays a deposit, the offender then contacts them as a fake shipping company to charge them more.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:44] - These scams are social engineering at its finest.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:04] - If the person building the website is skilled, legitimate websites can be copied as a fake.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:02] - For now, the best advice is to video chat with the breeder to see the pet.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one enjoys being on the receiving end of a business that manipulates or pushes you into buying something. Good business is about relationships where you are authentic, engaged, and building trust. Today’s guest is Scott Stratten. Scott is an author, podcast host, and an award winning keynote speaker. He is known for his energy, passion, knowledge, humor, and his man bun.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traveling can be a life-giving or a long lasting nightmare. Knowing what to research before you book your trip could have a significant impact on your experience and help you to be incredibly safe. Today’s guest is Asher Fergusson. Asher has been traveling around the world since 2004 when he left Australia to study in the United States where he received his undergraduate and master’s degrees. He has lived all over the globe, including in India, Europe, Hawaii, and the mainland US. He enjoys researching the travel industry and has been featured on CNN, USA Today, The New York Times, National Geographic, and many other publications.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:56] - Asher shares his background and how he got interested in travel.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:12] - On Asher’s website, he started sharing travel safety tips and the site has grown.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:44] - You will run into issues regarding cleanliness in hygiene and water. This can affect your body but is avoidable.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:57] - Asher shares several tips on eating and drinking in other countries.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:27] - When visiting another country, street food can be dangerous.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:20] - Every country has different cultural norms regarding food, water, shelter, and safety.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:31] - One of the major topics of research for Asher is regarding LGBTQ travelers.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:01] - Research laws in other countries because you could actually be imprisoned.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:24] - Another thing to consider is the dress code, especially for women in very conservative countries.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:37] - Some tourists feel that following stricter rules is a violation to their rights, but it is safer to follow the country’s laws and rules.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:17] - Americans tend to travel thinking that they don’t have to prepare and they are above the law.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:01] - America is a phenomenon as each state has different laws, a large population, and a lot of diversity.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:58] - Westerners tend to be targets for theft. Asher shares some things that might make you stand out.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:17] - There are other scams, but they are all about money.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:25] - It is always safer to go to the official site or location to buy tickets to something.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:43] - Asher shares the list of the top 10 worst locations to travel to as a solo female traveler. Do your research about your destination ahead of time.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:22] - Don’t be too nice. People might back off if you put up your boundaries.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:46] - When it comes to family traveling, accommodations are important.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:02] - Another hassle with traveling with kids in carseats and transportation upon your arrival.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:26] - Asher dug deep into Airbnb and customer horror stories.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[35:23] - Asher describes some of the issues found through this research.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[38:01] - It is probable that there is a money laundering scam happening in some listings and hacked accounts on Airbnb.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[40:56] - Never book a place with no reviews.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you own a business, your website represents you. Scammers can prey on your emotions for their gain by sending false claims of copyright infringement or even other lucrative opportunities that are fake. Knowing what to look out for prevents their negative impact on you and your business. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Liz Eisworth. Liz is the founder of SangFroid Web Design specializing in web design, custom WordPress themes, SEO, and digital marketing.

Some games do a better job than others on safety.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:15] - Eric talks daily to his children about safety in gaming. These conversations started before they were even playing it.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:03] - Setting rules ahead of time is important to avoid cleaning up a mess.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:23] - Kids tend to give out so much information easily.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:48] - What are the pieces of information that you should make sure are kept private? Eric says everything.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:01] - Even giving out gamer handles from other consoles shouldn’t be shared.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:28] - Consoles protect your IP address better but gaming on servers do not.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:25] - Almost everything these days is connected to the internet.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all have limited resources when it comes to time, money, and energy so in a world where people can create fake personas online, how can you be a part of a community that weeds out imposters? </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Ken Rutkowski.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the sense of anonymity, people often post false claims, lies, and private information that can impact a person’s livelihood. Illegal content such as copyright infringement, invasion of privacy, and defamation are on the rise on the internet. But there is something to be done about it. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Kenton Hutcherson. Kenton is an attorney and owner of Hutcherson Law. He and his team focus on a very specific niche of law: helping people, professionals, and businesses who have been attacked on the internet. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:11] - Kenton explains the three types of cases he works with - internet defamation, copyright infringement, and invasion of privacy.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:20] - Kenton shares his background and journey as an educator and lawyer.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:15] - The pandemic in particular caused a lot of interesting problems that Kenton has worked to solve.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:36] - Defamation encompasses libel and slander. Kenton explains the difference.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:00] - Written posts on the internet can harm people many years later.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:27] - When does it make sense to see a lawyer for internet defamation?</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:50] - Is the damage being caused worth the cost of a lawyer? Kenton describes the clients that usually merit hiring a lawyer.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:57] - Sometimes a bad situation is to cut your losses and move on.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:20] - You want a better life, not a better lawsuit.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety in public spaces can be complex. There are things that you can do to be prepared and alert in all situations. Techniques can be used to distract someone long enough to escape, no matter the size of the attacker. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Lieutenant Jessa Russell. Lieutenant Russell serves as the Community Relations Officer for Highland Park Department of Public Safety. In this role, she assists with crime prevention, safety education presentations, crime watch, community welfare concerns, and is the liaison to the Highland Park ISD. Lieutenant Russell began her career with Highland Park DPS in August 2008 and has served as a field training officer, defense tactics instructor, and operations supervisor. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:01] - Welcome to the podcast, Lieutenant Russell! Jessa explains how she got into law enforcement.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:40] - Every department has different norms. Jessa describes the more common problems her department responds to.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:10] - What is jugging? Jessa describes this crime and what to do to avoid it.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:06] - There are more fire stations than police stations and if you are being followed, pulling into a fire station could cause them to stop.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:01] - Always be skeptical. The world is a good place but there are bad people in it.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:12] - Restaurants and bars are places to have a heightened situational awareness.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:14] - If you are on a walk or run, only use one earbud.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:51] - You have to be assertive. Political correctness will hamper you when safety is a concern.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:30] - Park close to lights and the closer to the store the better. You can also request security officers or employees to escort you to the car.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:49] - There are different mindsets regarding an attack.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:12] - RAD is a program that Jessa educates through. It stands for Rape Aggression Defense. She explains the program and the training involved.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:58] - Some women are taught to be so submissive that they don’t realize they have power, which can simply be your voice.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:54] - Training does not mean you are a fighter. The techniques are designed to escape.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:20] - Most attackers are known to the victims, but random attacks can happen as well.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:28] - Assertively yelling “stay away” instead of screaming for help will catch someone’s attention more.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:33] - Chris shares a story to demonstrate how bystanders may not know if the situation is serious.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:47] - Jessa gives tips on how to help someone in danger.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:50] - Noticing clothes is great, but noticing shoes is even better.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[31:00] - Jessa explains what is important to note in describing an attacker.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:18] - Remembering the first few characters of a license plate is often enough to help. Remembering all is very challenging.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[36:50] - You need to know what to do if you are ever pulled over.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[39:43] - If someone is trying to rape you and you are not fighting back, you are not at fault at all. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[41:24] - Every department has a victim liaison.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[43:18] - Don’t be afraid to report something and work with the police.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[44:40] - Always lock doors and keep valuables in the house.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[47:41] - Jessa discusses carrying a gun and the importance of knowing how to properly use it if you want to have it.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most people, figuring out how our credit score is calculated is a black box. Learning what impacts your credit score gives you flexibility to change it. Here are twenty ways you are ruining your credit. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Steve Snyder. Steve is an author, speaker, and one of the top personal finance commentators in the country trained by the Fair Isaac Corporation, the firm that created the score that credit reporting agencies use to calculate a consumer’s credit worthiness. FICO Score is widely recognized as the industry standard for lenders. Steve has been quoted in the US News World Report, The Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, The Washington Post, and many others. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:03] - Welcome to the podcast, Steve! Steve describes what he does in his career and what got him interested.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:43] - Steve recovered from bankruptcy in less than eight months and realized that most people have no idea how to manage their credit.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:34] - The biggest mistake is not knowing that you have three credit scores.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:50] - The three scoring companies from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:41] - Not all lenders report to your credit reports which is why scores can be different.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:05] - There’s a system in place to correct things that are wrong with the large scoring companies.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:01] - Most people purchase the wrong scores. Most of the scores you are bombarded with online are fake.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:43] - Steve explains why the vantage score was created and why your FICO score is more important.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:01] - Debts going to collections, late payments, judgments, liens, bankruptcies, high utilization, negatively impact your credit.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:51] - Steve explains how shopping for cars and mortgages shows up as multiple inquiries on your credit.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:50] - Most people don’t realize that they have a utilization sweet spot.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:05] - No utilization can be bad for your credit score as well. You can have too much or too little.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:01] - Having a credit card is the first step. Using it is the second.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:45] - Your credit history goes back longer than just recent months and years.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:35] - You never want to randomly close credit accounts even if it is an unused card that you’ve had for a long time.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:40] - Never fight about your credit on your credit reports. If you have an issue, take it to small claims court.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:41] - Most people do not understand how credit works because we are not prepared early in life.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:21] - Steve is not going to ever risk his perfect credit scores by co-signing anything even with his own children.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:00] - Co-signing student loans can be detrimental.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:11] - It is wise to freeze your children’s credit until they are ready to use it.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[35:26] - Steve explains the meaning of “thickening a thin credit file.”</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[37:46] - People think that because they make a lot of money that money will take care of everything else.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[39:25] - Allowing collections to show on your credit is a huge mistake but is easily rectified.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[40:51] - Steve explains the difference between a charge off and a settlement.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[42:00] - Too many credit inquiries lowers your score but will also “spook lenders.”</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[43:16] - You could be paying off the wrong things.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most people, figuring out how our credit score is calculated is a black box. Learning what impacts your credit score gives you flexibility to change it. Here are twenty ways you are ruining your credit. </p> <p>Today’s guest is Steve Snyder. Steve is an author, speaker, and one of the top personal finance commentators in the country trained by the Fair Isaac Corporation, the firm that created the score that credit reporting agencies use to calculate a consumer’s credit worthiness. FICO Score is widely recognized as the industry standard for lenders. Steve has been quoted in the US News World Report, The Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, The Washington Post, and many others. </p> Show Notes: <ul> <li>[1:03] - Welcome to the podcast, Steve! Steve describes what he does in his career and what got him interested.</li> <li>[2:43] - Steve recovered from bankruptcy in less than eight months and realized that most people have no idea how to manage their credit.</li> <li>[3:34] - The biggest mistake is not knowing that you have three credit scores.</li> <li>[4:50] - The three scoring companies from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.</li> <li>[5:41] - Not all lenders report to your credit reports which is why scores can be different.</li> <li>[8:05] - There’s a system in place to correct things that are wrong with the large scoring companies.</li> <li>[9:01] - Most people purchase the wrong scores. Most of the scores you are bombarded with online are fake.</li> <li>[10:43] - Steve explains why the vantage score was created and why your FICO score is more important.</li> <li>[12:01] - Debts going to collections, late payments, judgments, liens, bankruptcies, high utilization, negatively impact your credit.</li> <li>[13:51] - Steve explains how shopping for cars and mortgages shows up as multiple inquiries on your credit.</li> <li>[15:50] - Most people don’t realize that they have a utilization sweet spot.</li> <li>[17:05] - No utilization can be bad for your credit score as well. You can have too much or too little.</li> <li>[19:01] - Having a credit card is the first step. Using it is the second.</li> <li>[21:45] - Your credit history goes back longer than just recent months and years.</li> <li>[23:35] - You never want to randomly close credit accounts even if it is an unused card that you’ve had for a long time.</li> <li>[24:40] - Never fight about your credit on your credit reports. If you have an issue, take it to small claims court.</li> <li>[27:41] - Most people do not understand how credit works because we are not prepared early in life.</li> <li>[29:21] - Steve is not going to ever risk his perfect credit scores by co-signing anything even with his own children.</li> <li>[32:00] - Co-signing student loans can be detrimental.</li> <li>[34:11] - It is wise to freeze your children’s credit until they are ready to use it.</li> <li>[35:26] - Steve explains the meaning of “thickening a thin credit file.”</li> <li>[37:46] - People think that because they make a lot of money that money will take care of everything else.</li> <li>[39:25] - Allowing collections to show on your credit is a huge mistake but is easily rectified.</li> <li>[40:51] - Steve explains the difference between a charge off and a settlement.</li> <li>[42:00] - Too many credit inquiries lowers your score but will also “spook lenders.”</li> <li>[43:16] - You could be paying off the wrong things. Your credit score is heavily weighted on your personal credit balance.</li> <li>[45:01] - Business and personal finances should be separate.</li> <li>[46:55] - No interest business credit cards are a great way to get started, but you have to be disciplined with a real business idea.</li> <li>[49:25] - The best time to apply for credit is when you don’t need it. Don’t wait for the emergency.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are methods used to influence us to either buy or do something. We may even be persuaded to participate and only later on wonder how they got us to join. It is beneficial to know these seven principles that compel us to react. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Dr. Robert Cialdini. Dr. Cialdini is an author and keynote speaker as a leading expert on influence and persuasion. His books are published in 44 different languages and have sold over 7 million copies. He’s a New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today best-selling author. He’s also been elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:10] - Dr. Cialdini got into this field because he was easily persuaded in the past.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:05] - Incognito, Dr. Cialdini answered as many ads and training programs he could get into to see how advertisers convinced people to buy.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:40] - In his research, he found that there are seven principles to persuasion.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:44] - The first principle is the principle of reciprocation. This is present in every culture.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:57] - First someone gives you something and then you feel obligated to give back.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:03] - Chris shares an experience at a restaurant to receive something for free that actually required him to do something first.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:37] - Is something genuinely giving you something or trapping you into compliance?</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:19] - The second principle is the principle of “liking.” You will be influenced more by those who you like.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:48] - One way to get people to like us is to give them something which ties right into the principle of reciprocity.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:12] - Step back from the situation and separate the salesperson from what he or she is offering.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:18] - The next principle is the principle of social proof. If a lot of people are choosing or favoring something, it seems like something you should do, too.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:28] - We recognize when there are fake reviews. 5 star reviews generally make us skeptical.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:04] - Dr. Cialdini describes a study done in McDonald’s that boosted sales of one menu item by 40%.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:48] - The next principle is similar to social proof and decreases someone’s uncertainty. It is the principle of authority.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:58] - The problem with assuming someone is an expert is the appearance of actors and influencers being paid to promote.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:34] - Ask yourself, “Is this person an authority on the topic at hand?”</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:32] - Also ask if the person is being unbiased in their testimonial.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[30:19] - The next principle is the principle of consistency. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:01] - Dr. Cialdini shares why he no longer signs petitions. The pressure to be consistent can motivate us to do things we don’t want to do.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[35:28] - Sometimes sales sites will list an item or booking that there are only two left at this price and list a number of people also looking at the listing.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[37:38] - We don’t know all the time if something is legit.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[39:55] - Dr. Cialdini added a seventh principle to his book called the principle of community.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[41:17] - Dr. Cialdini demonstrates how this works with a personal example.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[43:11] - Be wary of promotions within your “tribe.”</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[44:12] - Some companies will ask for collaboration to create unity and produce customer loyalty.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[47:09] - Dr. Cialdini shares a story about letting people into one’s house.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[50:55] - Check out Dr. Cialdini’s website for a Harvard article to help prevent digital attacks on your organization or business.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criminals feel safe to hide behind the internet. They hire people and train them to be effective salespeople with the goal of taking your money. Let’s look at a few ways to do our due diligence to be sure that who you are working with online are who they say they are. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Ken Gamble. Ken is a professional investigator, corporate security specialist, and cybercrime expert with 33 years of experience working for individuals and multinational corporations. He is the co-founder and executive chairman of IFW Global that conducts fraud investigations, asset tracking, fraud recovery, disruption and  prevention of global cybercrime, monitoring enforcement actions to protect and recover assets for worldwide clients. He is the current Australian chairman of the International Association of Cybercrime Prevention, a non-profit association founded in Paris in 2006. Ken is an accomplished surveillance specialist and former surveillance advisor contractor to a commonwealth government agency in Australia and a consultant to numerous law enforcement agencies in the US, Asia, and Europe as well as several foreign governments.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:23] - Ken shares his background and international experience.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:41] - In his career, Ken has worked in all sectors of investigation.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:50] - What inspired Ken to get into this field? The internet.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:00] - International crimes are very complicated to pursue which has made crime on the internet so impactful.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:01] - Although challenging, it is possible to track people down by following a digital footprint and mistakes. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:39] - The type of work Ken does is very high-end.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:47] - Ken has worked for foreign governments and government officials for many high-end cases.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:37] - Following the money doesn’t lead to the scammer.

We understand the risk of being vulnerable on our tablets and phones, but you’ll be shocked to realize how much data is collected from our other smart devices and how those very same devices can lead to a much wider compromise.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You cannot separate community and school safety from each other. They simply go hand in hand. We’ve seen adults displaying lack of impulse control on airplanes and as kids go back to school, we cannot underestimate the challenges that may arise. It’s important to be prepared to know how to respond. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Jason Stoddard. Jason is the Director of School Safety and Security for the Charles County Public Schools. He is responsible for sustaining a safe learning and work environment for over 27,000 students and nearly 4,000 staff members. He is a retired police commander with over 24 years in law enforcement. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:51] - Jason describes his job and what he is responsible for.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:40] - Because of everyone’s experience in school, everyone has their own opinion of what things should be like even though things have changed.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:00] - In recent years, ransomware and hacking has been a threat to schools.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:41] - School issues have not been seen as what they really are: community issues.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:50] - Jason shares ways he builds relationships within the community for school safety.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:10] - Handle With Care is a program that is implemented in Jason’s county.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:52] - Instead of asking what’s wrong, ask the kid what has happened.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:14] - We can never over communicate what is going on.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You cannot separate community and school safety from each other. They simply go hand in hand.

It’s important to be prepared to know how to respond. </p> <p>Today’s guest is Jason Stoddard. Jason is the Director of School Safety and Security for the Charles County Public Schools. He is responsible for sustaining a safe learning and work environment for over 27,000 students and nearly 4,000 staff members.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways your network can be accessed, not just remotely but physically. How equipped are you and your coworkers to prevent intrusions? Today’s guest is Jayson E. Street.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jayson is the author of</span> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Dissecting-Hack-F0rb1dd3n-Network-Revised/dp/1597495689"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dissecting the Hack: The F0rb1dd3n Network Series</span></em></a><em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">He is the DEFCON Groups Global Ambassador and the VP of InfoSec for SphereNY. He has also spoken at DEFCON, DerbyCon, GRRCon, and at several other cons and colleges on a variety of Information Security topics.

Jayson makes sure he is caught so he can provide education and training.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:08] - “The biggest thing that people can do to protect themselves is to listen to the voice in the back of your head saying that something is odd or unusual.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children go missing, exploited, and trafficked everyday. It takes investigators, prosecutors, and private sector technology specialists to help them. Misinformation and TV portrayals can impact our resources that are directed to help.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Kevin Metcalf. Kevin is a former federal agent turned prosecutor and the founder of The National Child Protection Task Force which brings together recognized experts in the field such as strategic legal applications, open source intelligence, cellular mapping analysis, dark web investigations, and cryptocurrency to help law enforcement agencies everywhere. He has undergone training provided by the National Computer Forensics Institute, the National White Collar Crime Center, and the FBI Cellular Analysis Survey Team, among others. Kevin developed a system for working with cell phone related data in criminal cases that developed into a mobile device foundational course that focuses on the integration of legally-derived information with open source information. Kevin has also published a series of instructional books available on Amazon.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:26] - Kevin shares his background and how starting the National Child Protection Task Force was not something he initially thought he’d do.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:20] - As a single parent, Kevin left his job in law enforcement, went back to school, and became a prosecutor.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:58] - As he was led into working in social media and cell phones, Kevin realized how often he was working on cases that had to do with children.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:11] - Kevin describes the case that got him national attention and how it led to him working with experts that wanted to come together to help more kids.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:01] - Chris notes the gap between law enforcement and the technology that is available. Kevin is trying to bridge that gap.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:00] - How does Kevin deal with the “CSI Effect”?</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:57] - There is a lot of misinformation regarding human trafficking. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:52] - It is very challenging to convict someone for human trafficking due to little information and the victim not being forthcoming with details out of fear.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:19] - Most of the time they are able to convict for something else, like drugs or gun charges, which does at least get the person in jail without putting the victim through testifying again.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:34] - There are a lot of psychological factors involved for victims even years afterwards.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:55] - Kevin’s organization works with missing, exploited, and trafficked children. He explains the difference between exploitation and trafficking.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:49] - Children who are missing and runaways are at higher risk of being exploited and trafficked. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:51] - There is a huge problem with missing children investigation or lack thereof. Predators are aware of this and take advantage.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:21] - There are so many problems with statistics that Kevin doesn’t know what questions to ask.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:18] - Kevin feels that there are two categories for children, missing or not.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:04] - Kevin lists some of the things that put children at risk, including parents trying to control everything.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:35] - During the grooming process, predators are looking for the weaknesses in a parent-child relationship. Mental health issues also add another level of vulnerability.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[31:10] - The NCPTF is composed of active duty law enforcement. Kevin explains following the rules of the jurisdiction they’re working in.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:51] - Although there are some controversial tools used to investigate these cases, Kevin describes how to prevent breaches in privacy.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[35:04] - “You have to understand the limitations of technology. If you don’t, you’re going to misuse it, screw up an investigation, and arrest the wrong person.”</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[36:19] - Kevin explains the algorithms used for facial recognition, especially using the face of a child.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[38:43] - An investigator needs to follow up on every hit used with facial recognition.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[39:59] - Kevin describes how the NCPTF hones their technology skills.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[41:38] - Predators are using information willingly posted on social media to harm others.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[42:51] - It is difficult to make politicians and policy makers understand how bad the situation is and what is needed to prosecute a predator.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[45:00] - Newer privacy laws make it difficult to use technology to identify a human trafficker.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[46:51] - Using these technological resources for minor infractions is a waste of time and money. They should be used for the major things.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[49:27] - It is important to not tip predators off with what they are using to identify them. Sometimes photos and videos will allow investigators to determine their location.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[51:14] - A lot of people don’t realize how easy it is to find their information.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

She is the host of the popular Astray Podcast where she investigates those who pay the ultimate cost in search for spiritual awakening.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:00] - Caroline shares how and why she started her Astray podcast.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:41] - There’s an idea that this happens in India, but Caroline points out that people seek out enlightenment all over the world.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:00] - During a difficult time, Caroline chose to go to Bali.

It is easier to do in the United States; to find others who have worked with them.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:55] - This industry is massive and brings in billions of dollars a year.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:32] - Caroline explains why she thinks the industry needs to be regulated.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:44] - Going with a buddy is key and bouncing ideas and plans off of friends is important to keep up the voice of reason.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:42] - Don’t make major decisions when experiencing grief or trauma.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:01] - We give away our own power when we hit rock bottom.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[30:45] - There are tragic stories that Caroline shares through Astray of people who have vanished or been killed.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:17] - The problem is not India Syndrome, it is “Seeker Syndrome.”</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:26] - What do you sacrifice for the risks you take?</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[35:18] - When seeing those traveling in a new country, there are those who will prey on someone new and unfamiliar.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education can help people to be prepared without paranoia, but how do you teach safety without causing fear? There are specific things to be aware of in an extraordinary situation like an active shooter that can fundamentally change the outcome. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Dr. Kathleen Kiernan. Dr. Kiernan is the founder and CEO of Kiernan Group Holdings, Chair of Emeritus and the Intelligence and National Security Alliance, and an adjunct faculty member of the Center for Homeland Defense and Security at the Naval Postgraduate School. As a 29-year veteran of Federal Law Enforcement, Dr. Kiernan serves as a subject matter expert in strategic thinking, strategy development, and facilitating critical incident management exercises for senior leaders across government and private sector organizations.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever had the feeling that someone is eavesdropping on your calls, reading your messages or emails, and even knows where you’ve been going, you just might be right. Abusers often utilize stalkerware to control and manipulate their targets. Being educated on what it is, how it got there, how to clean it off your devices, and where to go for help can make a world of difference.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Eva Galperin. Eva is the Director of Cybersecurity at The Electronic Frontier Foundation. She has worked in security and IT in Silicon Valley and earned degrees in Political Science and International Relations. She has applied the combination of her poli-sci and technical backgrounds to everything including organizing EFF’s TOR relay challenge to writing privacy and security training manuals. Those include Surveillance Self-Defense and The Digital First Aid Kit.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:21] - On her way to law school, Eva began working for Electronic Frontier Foundation and decided not to leave. She has worked in nearly every department.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:22] - Having worked in tech since a teen, Eva had a lot of experience with stalkerware. But she shares the reason why she was driven to research it further.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:02] - Through her own research and trials, Eva found that anti-virus apps did not protect against stalkerware.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:21] - Eva explains how abusers could react to stalkerware being removed from a device and leaves the decision up to the survivor on how and when to remove it.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:30] - There are companies that are now paying more attention to stalkerware. Eva explains that this is a good thing, but also believes that it is because there has been an increase in the use of stalkerware.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:24] - The most recent report of stalkerware being detected by antivirus programs indicates a range of 60-95% as compared to only 10% a few years ago.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:33] - In cases of domestic abuse, an abuser has physical access to a device and can install stalkerware without the survivor even knowing.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:10] - Spouses and partners having access to each other’s devices and knowing passwords is very common in modern relationships.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:22] - Eva recommends stalkerware detection apps for Android and Apple.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:01] - Chris and Eva discuss Windows and Mac OS stalkerware.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:32] - What is the difference between account compromise and device compromise? Eva says the more common problem is account compromise.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:01] - Eva recommends different and long passwords for each account you have as well as having two factor authorization turned on. She explains how this works.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:09] - Eva’s advice for consumers is to meet them where they are. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:13] - You should go into your account settings and look for the page that lists devices and IP addresses that have logged into your account if you feel something is going on.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:32] - Personal trackers that are meant for people to keep track of their belongings are essentially a gift to stalkers.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:11] - Regarding personal trackers, Eva shares that she has gotten some pushback on the abuse of these tools.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:32] - Software that allows you to do this without notifying the user so that they do not know that they are being watched is in and of itself abusive.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:01] - It is sad to see when people who have been abused feel that the only way they can take back power is to abuse as well.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:33] - Resetting to factory settings for most forms of device compromise is sufficient but you also need to change your account passwords and disable iCloud backups.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:51] - Eva loves open source for personal use, but as a general rule she doesn’t recommend it due to her security background.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:52] - If your cameras are compromised, covering the camera is a viable security measure. Covering microphones is trickier.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[30:43] - Chris and Eva discuss hackers hacking webcams, using blackmail photos, and sextortion emails.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:01] - Sometimes the extortion emails can confuse people severely enough to believe the scam.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:26] - Evan recommends the</span> <a href="https://nnedv.org/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">NNEDV</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">and</span> <a href= "https://safeescape.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operation Safe Escape</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for those looking for support.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[36:17] - The U.S. National Domestic Violence Hotline is 1-800-799-7233</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

Covering microphones is trickier.</li> <li>[30:43] - Chris and Eva discuss hackers hacking webcams, using blackmail photos, and sextortion emails.</li> <li>[33:01] - Sometimes the extortion emails can confuse people severely enough to believe the scam.</li> <li>[34:26] - Evan recommends the <a href="https://nnedv.org/">NNEDV</a> and <a href= "https://safeescape.org/">Operation Safe Escape</a> for those looking for support.</li> <li>[36:17] - The U.S. National Domestic Violence Hotline is 1-800-799-7233</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever felt the pressure to buy something because the website said there were just two left at that price or that the sale was ending soon, you’ve experienced just two of the many techniques using neuroscience to advertise online. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Roger Dooley. Roger is an author and international speaker. His books include</span> <a href= "https://www.rogerdooley.com/books/friction/"><em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Friction</span></em></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">, one of the Best Business Books of 2019, and</span> <a href= "https://www.rogerdooley.com/books/brainfluence/"><em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Brainfluence</span></em></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">now in 11 languages. He writes the popular Neuromarketing Blog and Brainy Marketing at Forbes.com. He co-founded College Confidential, the leading college-bound website.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:02] - Roger’s background began in engineering but he found his way into marketing.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:32] - Neuromarketing is using the understanding of how our brains work to market better. Roger describes it in more detail as well.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:47] - One of the major techniques using psychology in marketing is scarcity.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:27] - Another technique is to use social proof. Roger uses travel sites as an example.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:16] - Many large companies, specifically travel sites and hotels, hire psychologists for the purpose of marketing.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:50] - There’s nothing wrong with using scarcity in marketing, but Roger and Chris discuss those who do not use this technique ethically.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:03] - Chris shares a personal story of a sales job where his ethical selling and integrity created return customers.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:04] - The first step in recognizing the legitimacy of scarcity techniques is to be aware that they exist. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:27] - Roger discusses another technique called reciprocity.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:47] - Always evaluate the legitimacy of product reviews.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:33] - Authority is another technique used. Roger explains how the psychology behind this works.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:50] - Through Covid, the authority technique was seen often.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:30] - One area that Roger has been recently focused on is the area of friction. How does this work in the sales field? Amazon has been using it for a long time.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:33] - Roger shares a story about how LinkedIn used the friction technique.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:40] - Even news sites use the startup friction technique to gather subscribers.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:18] - How do vendors use</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">friction to retain subscribers or customers?</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:10] - The return process can also be sketchy, but in the case of Amazon, making this process easy has created reciprocal trust.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:07] - There are many rebate offers that can be abused that were very popularly used in the past. Roger explains how that worked and that it isn’t used as often anymore.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[36:20] - When you express the same deal to someone as a loss or a gain, the loss looms bigger than the gain. Deals like this prey on loss aversion.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[37:54] - There was some research done about random higher prices put onto specific items.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[39:14] - Decoy marketing is very popular recently because of the surge in subscription services.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[42:03] - Another form of decoy marketing is when there’s a better product offered at the same price of the lesser product.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[42:52] - Always look for things that might be manipulative.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[44:02] - Everyone is impacted by these techniques differently. Price sensitivity, urgency, and fear of missing out are traits that are affected differently.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[45:12] - AI is used to better control personalized/customized offers. Roger explains the pros and cons.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[47:28] - Generally speaking, engagement on video content is great. When AI suggested videos are accurate, things are great, but engagement can actually be weaponized.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[49:18] - What happens when there’s too much engagement?</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[51:51] - Adding friction in the right places can be a good thing for businesses.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you hear the word “hacker,” you envision someone breaking into a computer, but did you know that people can be hacked? The manipulation and persuasion of people can lead to someone gaining physical access to a location or even data being leaked. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Jenny Radcliffe. Jenny is the founder and director of Human Factor Security and is commonly known as the People Hacker. She’s a world-renowned social engineer hired to bypass security systems through a no-tech mixture of psychology, con-artistry, cunning, and guile. Jenny is also a podcaster, keynote speaker, talk show host, and panel chair.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:58] - Jenny explains social engineering as no-tech hacking and how she became known as the People Hacker.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:32] - Chris shares how a pen tester recently made a mistake and Jenny describes some of the mistakes she has made on that job.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:56] - Laughing at previous mistakes, Jenny shares a memorable experience where she almost got caught in the act.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:55] - In her experience, it is better to use psychology over breaking into a physical location.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:01] - Jenny shares a story about breaking into a museum as the first time she felt drawn to this lifestyle and years later it was an industry she could work for.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:30] - After a physical engagement and success in gathering the objects or data needed for the job, Jenny describes her adrenaline and celebration.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:05] - Physical entry can seem very theatrical as we’ve all seen in action movies like James Bond. But ideally, Jenny says that evidence someone was there should not be left behind.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:57] - Jenny sometimes leaves business cards in locations after she breaks into them and takes photos that she has saved.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:50] - There is an element of social engineering with pen testing.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:45] - Apparent authority is one of the top strategies used in social engineering. Jenny explains how Covid has made this even easier to dupe someone.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:40] - Criminals and social engineers capitalize on fear, uncertainty, and doubt. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:47] - During pen testing, a no-blame culture is crucial. Otherwise, people won’t report in times of actual penetration.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:12] - Even if you don’t think you are being scammed, you should always tell someone the second you are told to keep quiet about something.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:27] - Chris and Jenny discuss ransomware. In some cases, there is not an organization with a business model.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:01] - There have recently been a lot of high-profile ransomware hacks.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:17] - You have to try to remove the emotion for the victim so that payment is not made. It’s horrible but if the money is paid, they’ll come back.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:55] - How are these large companies getting hacked? How are hackers getting through?</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:36] - Have all the tech security in place but be aware that one person could still make a mistake.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[30:54] - The reason the cyber security industry is so huge is because, despite our best efforts, mistakes happen. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:07] - You can’t guarantee avoidance as long as humans are involved.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you hear the word “hacker,” you envision someone breaking into a computer, but did you know that people can be hacked? The manipulation and persuasion of people can lead to someone gaining physical access to a location or even data being leaked. </p> <p>Today’s guest is Jenny Radcliffe. Jenny is the founder and director of Human Factor Security and is commonly known as the People Hacker. She’s a world-renowned social engineer hired to bypass security systems through a no-tech mixture of psychology, con-artistry, cunning, and guile. Jenny is also a podcaster, keynote speaker, talk show host, and panel chair.</p> Show Notes: <ul> <li>[0:58] - Jenny explains social engineering as no-tech hacking and how she became known as the People Hacker.</li> <li>[2:32] - Chris shares how a pen tester recently made a mistake and Jenny describes some of the mistakes she has made on that job.</li> <li>[3:56] - Laughing at previous mistakes, Jenny shares a memorable experience where she almost got caught in the act.</li> <li>[5:55] - In her experience, it is better to use psychology over breaking into a physical location.</li> <li>[7:01] - Jenny shares a story about breaking into a museum as the first time she felt drawn to this lifestyle and years later it was an industry she could work for.</li> <li>[10:30] - After a physical engagement and success in gathering the objects or data needed for the job, Jenny describes her adrenaline and celebration.</li> <li>[13:05] - Physical entry can seem very theatrical as we’ve all seen in action movies like James Bond. But ideally, Jenny says that evidence someone was there should not be left behind.</li> <li>[14:57] - Jenny sometimes leaves business cards in locations after she breaks into them and takes photos that she has saved.</li> <li>[16:50] - There is an element of social engineering with pen testing.</li> <li>[17:45] - Apparent authority is one of the top strategies used in social engineering. Jenny explains how Covid has made this even easier to dupe someone.</li> <li>[19:40] - Criminals and social engineers capitalize on fear, uncertainty, and doubt. </li> <li>[20:47] - During pen testing, a no-blame culture is crucial. Otherwise, people won’t report in times of actual penetration.</li> <li>[22:12] - Even if you don’t think you are being scammed, you should always tell someone the second you are told to keep quiet about something.</li> <li>[23:27] - Chris and Jenny discuss ransomware. In some cases, there is not an organization with a business model.</li> <li>[25:01] - There have recently been a lot of high-profile ransomware hacks.</li> <li>[26:17] - You have to try to remove the emotion for the victim so that payment is not made. It’s horrible but if the money is paid, they’ll come back.</li> <li>[28:55] - How are these large companies getting hacked? How are hackers getting through?</li> <li>[29:36] - Have all the tech security in place but be aware that one person could still make a mistake.</li> <li>[30:54] - The reason the cyber security industry is so huge is because, despite our best efforts, mistakes happen. </li> <li>[32:07] - You can’t guarantee avoidance as long as humans are involved. With proper training and the right amount of suspicion, all we can do is hope everyone will remember to report anything unusual.</li> <li>[34:18] - In a compliance-minded organization, something as simple as a sign that says not to do something, they don’t question it.</li> <li>[36:49] - Jenny shares a story of being caught and them not ever saying anything that she was seen.</li> <li>[39:23] - “This is not my problem.” Chris and Jenny chat about Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and how some of the scenes apply to her job.</li> <li>[41:39] - Cyber security is something that defines how good a business is these days.</li> <li>[42:27] - When asked about things that go wrong during physical pen tests, Jenny says there are so many experiences that she tries to give a different answer to everyone who asks.</li> <li>[45:19] - Jenny shares the most boring physical pen test she experienced.</li> <li>[48:11] - Usually something goes wrong, so when something goes absolutely to plan, it is surprising for Jenny.</li> <li>[49:12] - Jenny shares the 4 things to do to stay safe.

			<link><![CDATA[https://www.easyprey.com/64]]></link>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child exploitation is an incredibly sensitive and difficult topic. It is vital to understand what resources are available to help the victims find healing.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Dr. Deaneè Johnson. Dr. Johnson has been a key player in advancing the victim services field at the federal, state, and local levels for over twenty years. As an OVC Fellow, she has assisted with collaborating with the DOJ to identify a range of child exploitation programs available nationwide, illuminating the best practices. She was most recently the chief program officer at the National Center for Victims of Crime before building her own consulting business Ascent Connection and Consulting Solutions. She also serves on the National Steering Committee for the Vision 21 Linking Systems of Care for Children and Youth, the Advisory Board for Preparedness Without Paranoia, and the Charles County Board of Education Safety in Maryland.</span></p> <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know or suspect child exploitation, sexual abuse, or any other kind of child victimization, contact the National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-422-4453. If you are looking for more resources as a victim of past child abuse, call Victim Connect at (855) 484-2846.</span></em></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Show Notes:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:39] - Dr. Johnson began her interest in this field of child exploitation in 1999 as a volunteer mentor. During her undergrad courses, she was focused on child abuse.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:27] - After Dr. Johnson received her degree in Criminal Justice, she started her Master’s in Counseling. She counseled adolescent youth that were victim of sexual abuse.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:15] - Through her experience in counseling, Dr. Johnson felt that something was stirred inside her and she no longer felt that counseling was the direction she should take.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:13] - Deaneè was given the opportunity to build a forensic interviewing program in a rural community in Texas. She got her masters and transferred her focus to forensic interviewing but still didn’t understand her drive.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:19] - She put all her energy and education towards the children who were victimized sexually.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:28] - Throughout her experiences, Deaneè had a memory pop up and realized that she did not have memories from her childhood other than images from photos. She had been a victim of sexual abuse.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:49] - Deaneè decided to go for her doctorate in Child Development with the drive to apply it to child victimization.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:13] - Any child can be a victim. No statistic is going to be solid because it is such an unreported crime.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:34] - 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 10 boys will be sexually victimized before their 18th birthday.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:03] - There is no specific population or demographic that has higher rates of victimization than others.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:00] - There are ways to minimize the likelihood of child exploitation but Dr. Johnson does not like to use the word prevention.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:23] - Dr. Johnson is a chairperson on the Advisory Board of Preparedness Without Paranoia. She explains the education they provide.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:55] - We’re really uncomfortable talking about sex with kids in general and now add on talking about</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">unwanted</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">sex. That discomfort will show to our kids.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:00] - If a child goes to their parents with a disclosure, we want to make sure the child knows that what they have to say is important and that keeps communication open.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:27] - Believe the child who discloses. Whether or not the child is telling the truth is not the job of the parent at that moment. The job is to listen to your child and be there for them.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:30] - If a child has been victimized once, it increases their likelihood of being victimized again. They need to have someone they can talk to about it.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:50] - There are two different types of disclosures: active and non-active or accidental.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:49] - Disclosure will vary child by child.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:14] - Victimization from a family member that the child loves may not be something they think is inappropriate.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:11] - Dr. Johnson defines grooming and examples of what this could look like. Grooming is a slow process and creates a false sense of trust.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:38] - Grooming usually ends with threats if children disclose. It is a vicious cycle that continues with the kids feeling isolated and ashamed.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:57] - The process of isolating a child or adolescent looks different in each situation and relationship.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Child exploitation is an incredibly sensitive and difficult topic. It is vital to understand what resources are available to help the victims find healing.</p> <p>Today’s guest is Dr. Deaneè Johnson. Dr. Johnson has been a key player in advancing the victim services field at the federal, state, and local levels for over twenty years. As an OVC Fellow, she has assisted with collaborating with the DOJ to identify a range of child exploitation programs available nationwide, illuminating the best practices. She was most recently the chief program officer at the National Center for Victims of Crime before building her own consulting business Ascent Connection and Consulting Solutions. She also serves on the National Steering Committee for the Vision 21 Linking Systems of Care for Children and Youth, the Advisory Board for Preparedness Without Paranoia, and the Charles County Board of Education Safety in Maryland.</p> <p><em>If you know or suspect child exploitation, sexual abuse, or any other kind of child victimization, contact the National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-422-4453. If you are looking for more resources as a victim of past child abuse, call Victim Connect at (855) 484-2846.</em></p> <p>Show Notes:</p> <ul> <li>[1:39] - Dr. Johnson began her interest in this field of child exploitation in 1999 as a volunteer mentor. During her undergrad courses, she was focused on child abuse.</li> <li>[2:27] - After Dr. Johnson received her degree in Criminal Justice, she started her Master’s in Counseling. She counseled adolescent youth that were victim of sexual abuse.</li> <li>[3:15] - Through her experience in counseling, Dr. Johnson felt that something was stirred inside her and she no longer felt that counseling was the direction she should take.</li> <li>[4:13] - Deaneè was given the opportunity to build a forensic interviewing program in a rural community in Texas. She got her masters and transferred her focus to forensic interviewing but still didn’t understand her drive.</li> <li>[5:19] - She put all her energy and education towards the children who were victimized sexually.</li> <li>[6:28] - Throughout her experiences, Deaneè had a memory pop up and realized that she did not have memories from her childhood other than images from photos. She had been a victim of sexual abuse.</li> <li>[7:49] - Deaneè decided to go for her doctorate in Child Development with the drive to apply it to child victimization.</li> <li>[9:13] - Any child can be a victim. No statistic is going to be solid because it is such an unreported crime.</li> <li>[10:34] - 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 10 boys will be sexually victimized before their 18th birthday.</li> <li>[11:03] - There is no specific population or demographic that has higher rates of victimization than others.</li> <li>[12:00] - There are ways to minimize the likelihood of child exploitation but Dr. Johnson does not like to use the word prevention.</li> <li>[13:23] - Dr. Johnson is a chairperson on the Advisory Board of Preparedness Without Paranoia. She explains the education they provide.</li> <li>[14:55] - We’re really uncomfortable talking about sex with kids in general and now add on talking about <em>unwanted</em> sex. That discomfort will show to our kids.</li> <li>[16:00] - If a child goes to their parents with a disclosure, we want to make sure the child knows that what they have to say is important and that keeps communication open.</li> <li>[17:27] - Believe the child who discloses. Whether or not the child is telling the truth is not the job of the parent at that moment. The job is to listen to your child and be there for them.</li> <li>[18:30] - If a child has been victimized once, it increases their likelihood of being victimized again. They need to have someone they can talk to about it.</li> <li>[19:50] - There are two different types of disclosures: active and non-active or accidental.</li> <li>[21:49] - Disclosure will vary child by child.</li> <li>[23:14] - Victimization from a family member that the child loves may not be something they think is inappropriate.</li> <li>[25:11] - Dr. Johnson defines grooming and examples of what this could look like. Grooming is a slow process and creates a false sense of trust.</li> <li>[26:38] - Grooming usually ends with threats if children disclose. It is a vicious cycle that continues with the kids feeling isolated and ashamed.</li> <li>[27:57] - The process of isolating a child or adolescent looks different in each situation and relationship. Dr. Johnson describes a story of an experience with a teenager she worked with.</li> <li>[30:01] - If you feel that there is something going on with a child you know, seeking help depends on the state you live in. Find out if you need to go to Child Protective Services and/or law enforcement.</li> <li>[32:09] - Dr. Johnson shares the contact information for the National Child Abuse Hotline and what they will assist with.</li> <li>[33:41] - She also shares the contact information for Victim Connect which is a resource for those who have been victimized in their own childhood.</li> <li>[34:19] - Many rape crisis centers offer counseling free of charge. Dr. Johnson shares other ways to get resources for healing in tribal communities.</li> <li>[36:41] - Dr. Johnson defines polyvictimization and how the cycle of abuse continues without intervention.</li> <li>[38:39] - There is a trajectory of polyvictimization that all starts with the early onset to exposure to violence, trauma, or childhood adversity.</li> <li>[40:36] - There is a higher likelihood that unaddressed trauma creates an adverse response. When you have individuals who do not have trauma addressed, their ability to cope and make good decisions decreases. </li> <li>[41:51] - The saying “hurt people will hurt people,” is somewhat true but not in every situation.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon is a huge enterprise that makes billions of dollars every year and grew 84% in 2020. Some scammers have capitalized on its success and have found ways to deceive Amazon’s customers for their own gain.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Shaahin Cheyene. Shaahin is an award-winning entrepreneur, investor, speaker, podcaster, writer, and filmmaker currently based in Los Angeles, California. He is the CEO and chairman of Accelerated Intelligence which is an Amazon marketing and advertising agency. He shares his passion for Amazon in his course Amazon Mastery and is also a featured mentor at the Founder Institute. Shaahin has been highlighted in many publications including Newsweek, The New York Times, Chicago Tribune, and The New York Post.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Show Notes:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:10] - Shaahin began in physical products while he was 16 years old. By the time he was 18, the company he was working with hit $1 billion.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:17] - Shaahin explains the importance of distribution and compares it to the film industry.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:59] - During the pandemic, Amazon increased revenue. Every time a company is “crushing it,” the scammers come out with something new.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:58] - One of the interesting things about the Amazon platform is that anybody can sell on Amazon. Shaahin explains how the “buy box” works.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:17] - Because any third party seller can sell on Amazon, some sellers will sell counterfeit or similar products to what is actually listed thinking that buyers won’t care.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:01] - If it is under $10, most consumers will not return it and although they received an inferior product than they thought they would get, the third party seller still earns the revenue.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:28] - Shaahin always recommends reading reviews on a product before buying and explains that it is about more than reading what people think of it.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:54] - Outside buying from brick and mortar stores or from recognizable name brands online, Shaahin also advises to Google the name of the seller.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:46] - One of the great things about Amazon is their return policy. Amazon will take any product back 99% of the time. You should always return something that does not meet expectations so Amazon gets the feedback.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:40] - Chris shares an experience in which he bought a product that stopped working a year later and when talking to customer service discovered that the serial number did not match their company.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:53] - Shaahin explains one of the Amazon buying hacks that can save buyers money.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:02] - As a consumer, price is a big factor. You want to try to buy when you can from Amazon themselves for that return policy and register for your warranty immediately on high ticket items.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:57] - Sometimes Amazon will refund you your money for your return without even requiring you to send the product back.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:12] - Unfortunately there are a lot of savvy scammers that are onto scamming third party sellers. Shaahin describes what they do.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:29] - If your return rate exceeds the amount of money Amazon will make, they will fire you as a customer.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:22] - Shaahin explains how a refund on a product for one of his clients wound up at his house with a fake returned product inside the box.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:11] - Chris and Shaahin agree that if a customer’s problem was fixed, they are more likely to not only buy again but to spread the word of a great experience than simply a satisfied customer.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:00] - Shaahin’s company changed the smoking industry. He explains how a buyer with extended warranties was trying to scam the company. Shaahin flipped the issue into an opportunity.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:57] - There’s a high cost to low price. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:51] - The terms of service on Amazon says that you cannot do anything to solicit reviews for your products. In the early days, people would leave fake reviews.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:21] - Over time, Amazon has installed super sophisticated security measures to clamp down on this issue.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:37] - Shaahin explains how third party sellers can get reviews.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:29] - There are a lot of companies that will sell consumers discounted products in exchange for honest reviews. This can be done through discount clubs.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[30:26] - The problem in these online marketplaces is that unless everyone follows every single rule, sellers will need to do what others are doing in order to build a business.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:11] - There’s so little incentive to leave organic reviews. Shaahin explains that a lot of the reviews are likely from resellers.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:36] - Chris explains how he was able to do some digging to find out how a specific scam works.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[36:03] - Shaahin and Chris discuss criminal activity and how people are out there who willingly take advantage of others and a lot have the mentality of people vs. corporations.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[38:36] - Shaahin was recently featured on the cover of a magazine and he shares the story of the interview.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[43:49] - There are scammers who claim to help you start your business on Amazon but can’t follow through. Shaahin offers an Amazon course where he hand picks his students and has a 100% success rate.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[44:50] - eCommerce is a form of real estate and investing in it can create a stream of residual income.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[47:01] - The difference between Shaahin’s course and Mastermind group and the courses of others is that Shaahin makes his money on Amazon. Other course creators are making their money on the course themselves.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[49:46] - You can trace success trajectory and their past just by searching it nowadays. If you are unsure about the claims of a course creator or an Amazon seller, do some research on Google.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A “deep fake” typically refers to a video that has been edited to replace the person in the original video with someone else, commonly a public figure in a way that makes the video look entirely authentic. These are time consuming to make but can be very convincing.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Lonnie Waugh. Lonnie is a web developer, software engineer, and deep fake creator. He has been doing deep fake videos for years with a sense of humor traditionally using the OneDuality on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:56] - Lonnie describes what a deep fake is and what he does for his YouTube channel to make things humorous.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:52] - To accomplish this in the past, it was very extensive, but now can be done from home with the right equipment and software.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:37] - The process to create something like this is very time consuming and Lonnie describes a frustration with rendering something and going back to edit.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:32] - Lonnie outlines what this process looks like for him and why he chooses political conferences for a lot of his videos.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:30] - In addition to finding all the movements needed for the face he’s using to replace the original, Lonnie also does some pre-processing. This isn’t necessary but he explains why he chooses to take the time to do it.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:02] - The software used to do this is open source but not yet available for Mac.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:18] - Because Lonnie has been doing this for so long, he knows what to look for to determine if the content is real or a deep fake, but points out that if you don’t know what to look for, it is easy to be fooled.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:27] - Lonnie and Chris describe some of the little nuances and indicators that Lonnie can notice.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:49] - Lonnie shares that he cannot monetize his YouTube channel because of the copyrighted content he uses so it is not worth his time to go back and fix some of the most minor indicators of it being fake.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:12] - Lighting also makes things challenging and Lonnie shares an experience with a music video director not consulting a professional.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:28] - Lonnie has created content for music videos and hopes to eventually create for commercials.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:38] - Discussing the technical aspects of the process, Lonnie describes how many frames a creator should use and how the AI recognizes faces.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:47] - There are different modes that creators can use.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:23] - Because of copyrights, there are challenges to deep fakes when using obvious original videos.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:21] - Politicians are typically in the public domain but celebrities and actors who have enough legal backing could find each video one by one and take them down. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:57] - For those who are not celebrities or political figures, there’s likely not enough video content available for a deep fake to be made of them. Lonnie says it can be done with photos but thousands of photos would be needed.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:51] - The quality of the video used is important as well.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:47] - There is an app that can take photos and video and replace faces. To Lonnie they look good but are obviously not real. Some people may be fooled by them, though.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:45] - At the moment it is not likely of someone creating a deep fake of someone with malicious intent unless there’s a lot of professionally done video content of them in all different kinds of lighting.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:38] - Lonnie and Chris discuss the amount of work involved in creating a convincing deep fake of the average Joe.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:29] - There is software that will use a single photo to impose onto a video but they are not convincing and are typically used for entertainment.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:40] - In regards to romance scams, Chris shares that this could eventually be something used to create video content.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:08] - Lonnie explains how another YouTuber has used clips to startle people.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:09] - There is a lot of thought being put into this in the political world and will potentially be legislated in the future.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:33] - While the technology can be abused, Lonnie has not yet seen it used in a dangerous way and says that the abuse of it is pretty predictable right now.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:11] - Lonnie references a recent legal case that may have abused this type of technology.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, deleting a file was considered safe data destruction. But we know that it only clears the pointer to the file and not the data itself. Today there are many options when it comes to destroying data even though some harddrives seem almost indestructible. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Paul Katzoff. Paul is the CEO of WhiteCanyon Software where they specialize in data erasure for businesses both corporate and government. These customers need secure data destruction that meets HIPAA and other compliance standards for harddrive and mobile device erasure.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:54] - Paul gives a background of himself and what WhiteCanyon Software is all about, starting back in 1995.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:02] - Data is becoming more and more important every year and Paul gives examples of current compliance legislation and standards.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:03] - Chris shares a story from years ago regarding purchasing used copiers, scanners, and other devices that unknowingly stored data.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:20] - Paul describes the data exposure that happened with this issue in 2011 as healthcare providers did not know their scanned documents were stored.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:32] - Regarding criminal activity using data on harddrives, Pail explains that more and more people are becoming a little more knowledgeable and on board with data destruction if needed but it hasn’t always been that way.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:39] - Paul describes what data destruction has looked like over the years including old technology like floppy disks and tapes.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:32] - Physical destruction only goes so far and software erasure is crucial now.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:11] - When you click “delete,” your file is not actually deleted.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:35] - Paul lists multiple erasure patterns and how it worked until about 2013 to erase any device out there.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:21] - There are some new requirements in data destruction that Paul explains and how they have had to adjust to make sure everything is erased.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:29] - WhiteCanyon Software has been working in data destruction for 23 years.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:14] - The current Covid-19 pandemic has complicated data as employees were then working from home and sometimes on a home computer.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:24] - Paul lists the concerns of accessing work networks on their home computers.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:26] - WhiteCanyon offers a product that corporations can send to their employees to click a link to erase their computer and then provides a QR code.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:33] - Regarding mobile devices and phones, your data is stored on that device even with an encryption reset. Paul describes concerns with encryption keys.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:21] - WhiteCanyon provides a certificate that everything has been destroyed. A lot of third party companies that wipe data especially from mobile devices can’t actually promise it’s completely erased.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:29] - One of the huge issues with data is once it leaves your facility sitting on a device, it can pop up a decade later.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:20] - Chris points out that data erasure is a “hard sell” for IT to bring forward to their company. Paul explains that it is certainly a cost because it doesn’t earn a company any money.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:59] - Paul explains what needs to be done to properly erase data on a nonworking drive.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:08] - If you would like to physically destroy a harddrive, Paul explains what he recommends. If you’d like it destroyed for you, there is a cost.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:35] - What most consumers can do for shredding home computers is search for companies that process second-hand computers and they have shredders on site.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:15] - Because harddrives hold so much, data destruction can take a lot of time. But if it is an SSD, it is far quicker to completely erase.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:50] - Chris and Paul discuss new devices that now hold data, including refrigerators.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:02] - WhiteCanyon offers two free downloads with the coupon code “homefree” to wipe a home computer or device. They offer this because they know everyone has several old computers or devices holed away that could be useful elsewhere.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[30:39] - Paul points out that data recovery software is free online so if data is not properly destroyed, it can be recovered by whoever has your harddrive.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[31:30] - Although we still store data on devices, network storage is extremely popular which makes things easier regarding data destruction for some consumers.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:04] - Paul strongly recommends pushing for harsher legislation for data protection and explains why this is crucial.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

Paul describes concerns with encryption keys.</li> <li>[18:21] - WhiteCanyon provides a certificate that everything has been destroyed. A lot of third party companies that wipe data especially from mobile devices can’t actually promise it’s completely erased.</li> <li>[19:29] - One of the huge issues with data is once it leaves your facility sitting on a device, it can pop up a decade later.</li> <li>[20:20] - Chris points out that data erasure is a “hard sell” for IT to bring forward to their company. Paul explains that it is certainly a cost because it doesn’t earn a company any money.</li> <li>[21:59] - Paul explains what needs to be done to properly erase data on a nonworking drive.</li> <li>[23:08] - If you would like to physically destroy a harddrive, Paul explains what he recommends. If you’d like it destroyed for you, there is a cost.</li> <li>[24:35] - What most consumers can do for shredding home computers is search for companies that process second-hand computers and they have shredders on site.</li> <li>[26:15] - Because harddrives hold so much, data destruction can take a lot of time. But if it is an SSD, it is far quicker to completely erase.</li> <li>[27:50] - Chris and Paul discuss new devices that now hold data, including refrigerators.</li> <li>[29:02] - WhiteCanyon offers two free downloads with the coupon code “homefree” to wipe a home computer or device. They offer this because they know everyone has several old computers or devices holed away that could be useful elsewhere.</li> <li>[30:39] - Paul points out that data recovery software is free online so if data is not properly destroyed, it can be recovered by whoever has your harddrive.</li> <li>[31:30] - Although we still store data on devices, network storage is extremely popular which makes things easier regarding data destruction for some consumers.</li> <li>[32:04] - Paul strongly recommends pushing for harsher legislation for data protection and explains why this is crucial.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gifted hackers can access data from a government website, a hospital medical system, or even a car. Most are not aware when their personal information is stolen, sold, and used until it is too late. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Alissa Knight. Alissa is a recovering hacker of 20 years, a cyber security influencer, content creator, and the principal cyber security analyst at</span> <a href= "https://www.alissaknight.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Alissa Knight and Associates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

It’s told through the eyes of the defender. Very rarely do we see content being told through the eyes of the adversary.”</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:13] - Alissa describes what she wants people to see through her content.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:58] - In Alissa’s opinion, we need to relearn the concept of prevention.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:27] - Chris points out that many mistakes are made when people think they have an impenetrable system. They become complacent.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:20] - There are so many products out there right now that become very overwhelming and many don’t know what to choose or buy.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:17] - Alissa breaks down the categories of mHealth and describes how she was able to hack into them.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:59] - When testing these systems through hacking, Alissa was shocked at how much information she was able to access about patients.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:01] - Alissa explains the rule that CMS passed called FHIR.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:36] - Describing the systems that hospital systems use, Alissa points out some issues with lack of security.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:48] - Alissa shares a personal story about being diagnosed with cancer and the experience of getting an email with her medical data available through a mobile app.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:21] - The average person is not digging deep to find where their information could have been published on the darkweb.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[30:54] - Alissa explains the differences between what some providers can and cannot do with data. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[31:41] - To explain a BOLA vulnerability, Alissa uses an easy to visualize analogy.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:58] - Some of the problems in the APIs that Alissa is testing is insecure coding and programming. She lists how this can see patient health information in medical systems.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[35:13] - Simply changing an ID slightly once it has been authenticated is the number 1 vulnerability in APIs. Alissa says it's the easiest hack in the world.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[36:08] - Sharing a story about an experience with a pen tester, Chris demonstrates how important testing for vulnerabilities is.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[38:16] - We as consumers have to rely on manufacturers to make more secure cars and our healthcare providers to create more secure programs. It’s unfortunately out of our hands.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[39:54] - It is not an immediate thing to learn. Alissa points out the many tools and the importance of understanding them.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[42:16] - Exploits and these penetration testing tools are important, but if they are in the wrong hands they can be used for different purposes.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[43:32] - When the developer is responsible for data, it leads to many problems.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all lies are scams, but everyone lies, even if it's only about someone’s birthday gift. Liars give out both verbal and nonverbal cues, but how do you know what they are? Listen to this episode to learn how to spot a lie.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Pamela Meyer. Pamela is certified fraud examiner, international speaker, entrepreneur, and the author of</span> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Liespotting-Proven-Techniques-Detect-Deception/dp/0312611730"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lie Spotting: Proven Techniques to Detect Deception</span></em></a><em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">Her TEDtalk “How to Spot a Liar” is one of the 15 most popular TEDtalks of all time with over 30 million views. She has been featured on NPR, CNN, ABC, Forbes, The Washington Post, and The New York Post, and she writes regularly for The Huffington Post. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:03] - Pamela’s background is in business and for many years she was in media. She had developed some websites and sold them. She shared how a Harvard Business School reunion sparked her interest in deception.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:41] - When Pamela returned home from the reunion, she realized that there was a huge interest in the topic of deception but that the information on it was inaccessible.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:31] - Pamela shares the story that is also featured in her book</span> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Liespotting-Proven-Techniques-Detect-Deception/dp/0312611730"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lie Spotting</span></em></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about an assistant she had many years ago.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:56] - Just because it is taught in the CIA, doesn’t mean it can’t be learned by the public.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:23] - The myth of lie detection is that it is simple. It is actually quite complex.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:02] - Pamela shares another myth regarding lie detection through the eyes.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:10] - When someone is lying, sometimes people will try to overcompensate their body language to appear truthful.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:20] - What’s important with lie detection is starting with baselining. One indicator doesn’t mean anything and Pamela describes why.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:02] - If you know someone very well and you notice that something is a little off, it could be an indicator for lying. Pamela explains that someone trained in detection will be able to note exactly what is off.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:52] - Professionals can usually determine a baseline for someone and detect lies within a half hour, 15 minutes, or even 5 minutes.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:56] - If you are having a difficult conversation, what you’re looking for are energetic changes.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:53] - Pamela begins sharing a good starting point called BASIC in learning detection which is a 5 step process. This is different from the advanced masterclass she offers.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:03] - The first step is B for Baselining. A is for Ask open ended questions.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:07] - Be warm and be in an environment that is free from distraction. Sit in a non-threatening way and make the person feel comfortable.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:47] - Be authentic with building rapport with someone. Prepare for harder conversations ahead of time.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:39] - The biggest issue with cues to verbal and nonverbal deceit is what we call Cognitive Load. When you’re trying to think what to say, act composed, appear spontaneous, if you are lying you leak verbal and nonverbal cues.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:03] - Pamela shares some nonverbal cues that someone who is lying could adopt when in conversation with you.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:37] - The verbal cues in a difficult conversation could be pushing the main point of conversation off to the end. Someone who is truthful will typically tell a story with a beginning, middle, and an end. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:29] - Pamela describes some verbal cues that could mean deception.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:40] - These methods are not weapons. They’re just techniques to help you get to the truth. Deception isn’t always indicative of something bad.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:22] - Everyone lies. Although the term “lying” has a negative connotation.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:01] - S in BASIC is “Study the clusters.” Look at the cues and study them. I is for “Intuiting the gaps.” Keep your instincts in mind and identify and fill in the holes.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:37] - Pamela describes behavior gaps and emotion gaps. What is the person saying and are they flashing contradictory facial expressions or body movements?</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:10] - These indicators are not to point fingers and call the person a liar. They are to give you more information and give you guidance on the harder questions to ask.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:32] - C is to confirm. After you’ve done everything prior, you need to now ask the questions that will confirm your thoughts of deceit. These questions often indicate that you have some information that you might not have.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[30:18] - Pamela gives some examples of what a truthful person will say to answer these questions and what a deceitful person will say.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[31:17] - You don’t always have to use these questions and in most cases you won’t need to. But Pamela has several that she keeps in her back pocket in the event that she needs more.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:09] - A good interrogator or interviewer is prepared. If you are an artful interviewer, you will be prepared with tons of questions to determine that Cognitive Load.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:13] - To answer the question of “can you teach me to lie?” Pamela says no because anyone who is really talented at interrogation will be able to detect deception.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:07] - We all have biases and blindspots. So we are not completely immune to being conned or lied to.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:57] - We are past polygraph tests these days. There is a lot of technology out there to detect deception. It can’t be used in all settings but it's available.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[37:34] - There is a lot of technology that is effective and some that is not. Pamela gives some examples of studies that are going on currently.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[39:08] - Chris and Pamela discuss the problem of cyberthreats and not knowing the baseline of someone.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not all lies are scams, but everyone lies, even if it's only about someone’s birthday gift. Liars give out both verbal and nonverbal cues, but how do you know what they are? Listen to this episode to learn how to spot a lie.</p> <p>Today’s guest is Pamela Meyer. Pamela is certified fraud examiner, international speaker, entrepreneur, and the author of <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Liespotting-Proven-Techniques-Detect-Deception/dp/0312611730"> <em>Lie Spotting: Proven Techniques to Detect Deception</em></a><em>.</em> Her TEDtalk “How to Spot a Liar” is one of the 15 most popular TEDtalks of all time with over 30 million views. She has been featured on NPR, CNN, ABC, Forbes, The Washington Post, and The New York Post, and she writes regularly for The Huffington Post. </p> Show Notes: <ul> <li>[1:03] - Pamela’s background is in business and for many years she was in media. She had developed some websites and sold them. She shared how a Harvard Business School reunion sparked her interest in deception.</li> <li>[2:41] - When Pamela returned home from the reunion, she realized that there was a huge interest in the topic of deception but that the information on it was inaccessible.</li> <li>[3:31] - Pamela shares the story that is also featured in her book <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Liespotting-Proven-Techniques-Detect-Deception/dp/0312611730"> <em>Lie Spotting</em></a>, about an assistant she had many years ago.</li> <li>[4:56] - Just because it is taught in the CIA, doesn’t mean it can’t be learned by the public.</li> <li>[5:23] - The myth of lie detection is that it is simple. It is actually quite complex.</li> <li>[6:02] - Pamela shares another myth regarding lie detection through the eyes.</li> <li>[7:10] - When someone is lying, sometimes people will try to overcompensate their body language to appear truthful.</li> <li>[8:20] - What’s important with lie detection is starting with baselining. One indicator doesn’t mean anything and Pamela describes why.</li> <li>[10:02] - If you know someone very well and you notice that something is a little off, it could be an indicator for lying. Pamela explains that someone trained in detection will be able to note exactly what is off.</li> <li>[10:52] - Professionals can usually determine a baseline for someone and detect lies within a half hour, 15 minutes, or even 5 minutes.</li> <li>[11:56] - If you are having a difficult conversation, what you’re looking for are energetic changes.</li> <li>[12:53] - Pamela begins sharing a good starting point called BASIC in learning detection which is a 5 step process. This is different from the advanced masterclass she offers.</li> <li>[13:03] - The first step is B for Baselining. A is for Ask open ended questions.</li> <li>[14:07] - Be warm and be in an environment that is free from distraction. Sit in a non-threatening way and make the person feel comfortable.</li> <li>[15:47] - Be authentic with building rapport with someone. Prepare for harder conversations ahead of time.</li> <li>[17:39] - The biggest issue with cues to verbal and nonverbal deceit is what we call Cognitive Load. When you’re trying to think what to say, act composed, appear spontaneous, if you are lying you leak verbal and nonverbal cues.</li> <li>[19:03] - Pamela shares some nonverbal cues that someone who is lying could adopt when in conversation with you.</li> <li>[20:37] - The verbal cues in a difficult conversation could be pushing the main point of conversation off to the end. Someone who is truthful will typically tell a story with a beginning, middle, and an end. </li> <li>[21:29] - Pamela describes some verbal cues that could mean deception.</li> <li>[22:40] - These methods are not weapons.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all social media influencers are equal. Just because someone has a ton of followers doesn’t mean they actually have any influence on their audience. It’s important that we learn to be critical thinkers that do research and not just believe what we hear and read. Whether you’re a business looking to use an influencer to promote your product, or you’re interested in becoming an influencer yourself, this is the episode for you.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Neal Schaffer. Neal is an authority on helping innovative businesses digitally transform their sales and marketing. He’s the founder of the digital marketing consultancy PDCA Social and currently serves as a fractional CMO to several companies. He teaches at Rutgers Business School and the Irish Management Institute and is fluent in Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.

Neal explains how social media really works and what questions he asks when looking deeply at influencer profiles.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:30] - People have to be smart enough and to have a critical mind and analyze what they see. Don’t take anything at face value.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:37] - Neal compares looking into a social media influencer or someone who seems to be an influencer to shopping on Amazon.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:30] - The book</span> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Age-Influence-Power-Influencers-Elevate/dp/1400216362/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=&linkCode=sl1&tag=windminetwor-20&linkId=241999fadb26f6bc02547da69ae16ee6&language=en_US"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Age of Influence</span></em></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Neal Schaffer answers a lot of questions for business owners looking to potentially hire an influencer.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:09] - Neal describes how influencer marketing works and what a lot of business owners assume it is like.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:21] - If you are going to reach out to someone to promote your product, ask them honestly if they’ve used your product. If they don’t care about your product, why would you want them to promote it? Reach out to the right people.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:39] - Chris shares “influencer fails.” If you treat an influencer like you are hiring them for a project with specific details and restrictions, the worse and less genuine the content is going to be.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:29] - Influencers can create better content that any business so restricting them is counterproductive.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:41] - When it is a cut and paste, people can see that. You would be introducing a foreign element into their community.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:51] - Neal and Chris discuss government involvement in influencer marketing and the potential future in regulations.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:52] - Neal shares that as a content creator himself, he has been approached by businesses who say they want to work with him but they do not want him to use the term “sponsored.”</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:47] - Disclosures are required but the post can still be genuine.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:31] - Neal suggests some ways to engage with and develop genuine relationships with influencers that will help in the long run.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:42] - Good influencers turn down the sponsorships and product promotions that don’t make sense for their own brand.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:49] - Becoming an influencer is a long haul. Becoming more influential as a side hustle is more realistic. You’re not going to become a millionaire overnight. Because it is a long haul, it needs to be something you are passionate about.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:14] - Because you are passionate about your niche, you draw people who are also passionate about it and over time you will influence them.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:46] - As an influencer, keep a short list of brands that you would love to have sponsor you and work to keep your passion clear to draw the followers that will connect with you.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:26] - There’s no shortcut to the process of becoming an influencer. It is hard work but with strategy it can happen.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:50] - There are going to be people that push back. Part of building fans is standing up for your niche. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:04] - Your profile is your space. If someone is invading your space with negative comments, it is totally okay to delete and block. Your community will likely support you.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:48] - Neal tells a story about a game he plays on his phone and how it is similar to taking care of your community of followers.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:26] - If you are a business owner, influencers are an excellent opportunity. If you are a consumer, treat influencers like Amazon product reviews. If you want to become an influencer, don’t do it for the money. Do it for the passion.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

You would be introducing a foreign element into their community.</li> <li>[13:51] - Neal and Chris discuss government involvement in influencer marketing and the potential future in regulations.</li> <li>[14:52] - Neal shares that as a content creator himself, he has been approached by businesses who say they want to work with him but they do not want him to use the term “sponsored.”</li> <li>[15:47] - Disclosures are required but the post can still be genuine.</li> <li>[16:31] - Neal suggests some ways to engage with and develop genuine relationships with influencers that will help in the long run.</li> <li>[17:42] - Good influencers turn down the sponsorships and product promotions that don’t make sense for their own brand.</li> <li>[19:49] - Becoming an influencer is a long haul. Becoming more influential as a side hustle is more realistic. You’re not going to become a millionaire overnight. Because it is a long haul, it needs to be something you are passionate about.</li> <li>[21:14] - Because you are passionate about your niche, you draw people who are also passionate about it and over time you will influence them.</li> <li>[22:46] - As an influencer, keep a short list of brands that you would love to have sponsor you and work to keep your passion clear to draw the followers that will connect with you.</li> <li>[24:26] - There’s no shortcut to the process of becoming an influencer. It is hard work but with strategy it can happen.</li> <li>[25:50] - There are going to be people that push back. Part of building fans is standing up for your niche. </li> <li>[27:04] - Your profile is your space. If someone is invading your space with negative comments, it is totally okay to delete and block. Your community will likely support you.</li> <li>[27:48] - Neal tells a story about a game he plays on his phone and how it is similar to taking care of your community of followers.</li> <li>[29:26] - If you are a business owner, influencers are an excellent opportunity. If you are a consumer, treat influencers like Amazon product reviews. If you want to become an influencer, don’t do it for the money. Do it for the passion.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pets are one way to get to someone’s heart and their wallet. Purchasing a dog is an investment that scammers can try to manipulate for their own advantage.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Brandi Hunter. Brandi has been in public relations and communications for over 15 years. The past five years she has been working for the American Kennel Club commonly known as the AKC. The AKC is over 135 years old and the largest pure-bred registry in the United States. The AKC is passionate about all breeds of dogs, their sports, and their safety. Brandi shares many different resources that are available and scams to watch out for.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:54] - Brandi shares some background on herself working in communications and the background of the AKC.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:48] - AKC’s mission is to protect all dogs and make sure they have the happiest and healthiest life possible.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:11] - The first thing you need to do before purchasing a pet, you need to assess your life and look at your lifestyle and household to make sure you can.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:45] - Brandi also recommends you take a moment to discover if rescuing is what you should do or if you should go through a breeder.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:07] - If going through a breeder, you need to make sure you are going through a reputable source. AKC has a marketplace that has a compliance program that Brandi describes.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:02] - Brandi says to research breeds as well to make sure that their traits and typical behaviors make sense for your lifestyle.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:10] - Be careful if you are on a website for a breeder. Double check by calling the AKC to see if they are registered. Brandi says that it is easy for someone to copy and paste a logo or make a website a scam.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:12] - Chris shares his story in searching for a Mini Schnauzer.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:01] - Brandi explains how some breeds are not good for first time dog owners.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:02] - Chris and his wife found a breeder near a family member’s home. His family member trains service dogs and decided to have her go look at the dog and breeder, the breeder completely stopped communicating.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:35] - Responsible breeders want to meet you and make sure the dog is going to a good home.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:53] - In every case Brandi has ever seen with responsible breeders, the breeder will say to bring the dog back if it is not the right fit. This reduces surrender.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:57] - When Chris and his wife found the right breeder, he described the difference in experience. She was very communicative and cared about the dog.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:01] - Nobody that is intentionally breeding wants their dogs to end up in shelters. That’s not why you put the work in. Breeding is a lot of work.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:34] - A puppy mill is not a term the AKC uses because they do not encourage the practice. But it is when someone breeds irresponsibility in mass after receiving money.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:58] - Puppy mills and backyard breeders do not do health checks because they are only concerned about earning money.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:02] - Breeding this irresponsibly is unscrupulous and completely unhealthy for the parents and the puppies. When this happens you can usually tell based on looks and behavior.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:08] - A red flag will also be exorbitant prices and the breeder telling you that the puppy is exotic.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:02] - Another sign to watch out for is that the breeder doesn’t ask you any questions to make sure the dog is going to a good home. They only want to know that you can pay for it.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:56] - When paying for a dog, Brandi says do not use Western Union or other methods of wiring money that you cannot trace. Use your credit card because you can report fraud.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:33] - Another red flag is that a scammer will ask for money right away. That is the first thing they will talk about.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:19] - Brandi lists some other red flags including refusal to provide papers and bad grammar on websites.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:47] - When contacting a phone number on a website, always call. Numbers that you can’t call but you can receive texts from is another red flag.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:59] - Brandi recommends to reverse look-up a photo to see if it is a stock photo used elsewhere or to copy and paste testimonials from their website into Google.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:40] - There will be no financial surprises with a reputable breeder. Brandi lists some ways scammers and irresponsible breeders will spring additional fees.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:34] - Responsible breeders will work with a contract. They will have a copy and you will have one.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:56] - Pricing a dog is at the discretion of the breeder, not the AKC. It is random and arbitrary so there will be no hidden costs that pop up.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:50] - Brandi describes a common lost dog scam. It tugs on the emotion of the pet owner.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:10] - You should always have your dog microchipped or have tags on your dog in the event they get lost. If someone calls and claims to have your dog, they need to send you a picture of the tags.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:47] - Pay attention to what they’re saying and to what they’re not saying. This is good advice for someone who claimed to find your dog or a breeder you are in contact with to purchase.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[31:09] - A legitimate person is only concerned with reuniting you with your dog. They should get the reward money only when the dog is returned, not before.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:33] - “Do your research. We know that puppies are an impulsive buying decision. The minute that warm little nose touches your cheek, it’s over for any straightforward thought you’re thinking. But the desire for the pet should never outweigh your logic.” - Brandi Hunter</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:41] - If a pet store or a shelter is doing it right, they are protecting the animal. Take the right path for you.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:23] - There is a wealth of information on AKC’s website, including quizzes, articles, and videos to help plan.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many assume that dating scams only take place online. A scenario where they create an emotional connection over a period of time and eventually start asking for money. Today, we talk with someone who was deceived in person and how to see the warning signs in real life.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Abby Ellin. Abby has been a freelance writer for 20 years. She has mostly written for The New York Times but has been published in countless other publications including Time and The London Daily Telegraph. Abby’s latest book</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Duped: Double Lives, False Identities, and the Con Man I Almost Married</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">was published in 2019 and is the topic of today’s discussion.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:14] - The reason Chris wanted Abby on the podcast was because Abby’s experience is different from the more common online dating scams.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:40] - Very briefly, Abby was engaged to a man who turned out to be a pathological liar. She felt something was off and left him within a year. But later she got a phone call.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:14] - It turned out that the man was using Abby’s name to write prescriptions for drugs. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:40] - Abby jumped into journalist mode and interviewed the people in the man’s life who he had also been deceiving.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:17] - Abby explains the true things that were not deceptions: he had been a doctor in the Navy and was from Jacksonville, Florida.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:42] - When he didn’t want Abby coming to Jacksonville with him it was because he was engaged to another woman who he lived with there. He would tell the other woman he was on a secret mission and would leave for long periods of time.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:25] - Nothing was verifiable which drove the journalist side of Abby nuts.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:14] - Abby initially met him during an interview. She was interviewing him as a doctor and when fact checking he shared that he was opening up a facility in Iraq and Afghanistan for kids with cancer. They kept in touch because of the story she could write.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:25] - Abby describes his pattern starting with marrying someone, leaving them, and moving to another marriage.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:07] - It wasn’t just “love fraud,” it was a real con. He was using names of people he had been with romantically as well as names of the people he worked with to get drugs for himself.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:58] - Abby was suspicious and left him after a year. She shares a story about a time he lied to her parents so convincingly and it made her concerned about other possible lies.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:17] - Some red flags Abby noticed were that he would always cancel plans last minute and unusual things would happen when she was out of town.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:15] - Chris and Abby discuss how people use the claim of being in the military as their adopted persona because we don’t tend to question that. But the man she was engaged to was in fact in the military.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:10] - He was a military doctor and you don’t ever expect someone in that kind of position to be a “bad egg.”</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:19] - Abby explains that he was caught for using drugs but he had gotten a hold of so much that she is also convinced that he was selling.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:40] - For online scams, the goal is to receive money and the manipulation is a means to an end. For some in person scams, sometimes the manipulation is part of the goal, too.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:51] - Because Abby had been suspicious and was not forthcoming about financial information, she did not lose any money. She says that if that had been his goal with her, she was a failed scam. But he did ask a few times about finances.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:47] - When asked about trust, Abby explains that we are programmed to trust and that society will not function without it.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:53] - Those gut feelings, intuition, or what Abby calls the “Spidey-sense,” can be right. Listen to your gut.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:34] - Abby shares a story about a woman she just recently started seeing and how her gut feeling was actually wrong. She had been projecting her baggage to someone else’s scenario.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:03] - When you see a photo of someone on a dating app who is in a military uniform, it is a scam. People who are truly in the military won’t be using a photo like that for their profile.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:25] - There are some people who thrive on manipulating others. If the goal is to dupe someone for money, Abby thinks that scamming a freelance journalist was not the best plan for that goal.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:58] - Abby shares that she called a scammer back one time just to see what would happen.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:01] - Chris describes how sophisticated scams have gotten.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:55] - The minute someone asks for money, that should be the end of the conversation.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:01] - It is really hard to deal with an in-person situation like Abby was involved in because you have met them and you do have a relationship with them rather than an online dating scam where you don’t meet them in person.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:58] - You need to know what someone’s baseline is. There is not a specific set of behaviors that indicate someone is lying. Everyone is different so take notice of things that are out of the ordinary for them.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:44] - Abby discusses polygraph tests and how she needs to have hard evidence.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[31:33] - In Abby’s situation, the man she was engaged to had duped his entire family.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:02] - It became so much a problem for him, that lying became his default. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:29] - Abby shares a story about another red flag about their living situation. She caught him in a lie and she is convinced he believed his own lies.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[37:05] - Abby will be starting a podcast to share more details of her experience soon.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many assume that dating scams only take place online. A scenario where they create an emotional connection over a period of time and eventually start asking for money. Today, we talk with someone who was deceived in person and how to see the warning signs in real life.</p> <p>Today’s guest is Abby Ellin. Abby has been a freelance writer for 20 years. She has mostly written for The New York Times but has been published in countless other publications including Time and The London Daily Telegraph. Abby’s latest book <em>Duped: Double Lives, False Identities, and the Con Man I Almost Married</em> was published in 2019 and is the topic of today’s discussion.</p> Show Notes: <ul> <li>[1:14] - The reason Chris wanted Abby on the podcast was because Abby’s experience is different from the more common online dating scams.</li> <li>[1:40] - Very briefly, Abby was engaged to a man who turned out to be a pathological liar. She felt something was off and left him within a year. But later she got a phone call.</li> <li>[2:14] - It turned out that the man was using Abby’s name to write prescriptions for drugs. </li> <li>[2:40] - Abby jumped into journalist mode and interviewed the people in the man’s life who he had also been deceiving.</li> <li>[4:17] - Abby explains the true things that were not deceptions: he had been a doctor in the Navy and was from Jacksonville, Florida.</li> <li>[4:42] - When he didn’t want Abby coming to Jacksonville with him it was because he was engaged to another woman who he lived with there. He would tell the other woman he was on a secret mission and would leave for long periods of time.</li> <li>[5:25] - Nothing was verifiable which drove the journalist side of Abby nuts.</li> <li>[6:14] - Abby initially met him during an interview. She was interviewing him as a doctor and when fact checking he shared that he was opening up a facility in Iraq and Afghanistan for kids with cancer. They kept in touch because of the story she could write.</li> <li>[7:25] - Abby describes his pattern starting with marrying someone, leaving them, and moving to another marriage.</li> <li>[8:07] - It wasn’t just “love fraud,” it was a real con. He was using names of people he had been with romantically as well as names of the people he worked with to get drugs for himself.</li> <li>[8:58] - Abby was suspicious and left him after a year. She shares a story about a time he lied to her parents so convincingly and it made her concerned about other possible lies.</li> <li>[10:17] - Some red flags Abby noticed were that he would always cancel plans last minute and unusual things would happen when she was out of town.</li> <li>[11:15] - Chris and Abby discuss how people use the claim of being in the military as their adopted persona because we don’t tend to question that. But the man she was engaged to was in fact in the military.</li> <li>[12:10] - He was a military doctor and you don’t ever expect someone in that kind of position to be a “bad egg.”</li> <li>[13:19] - Abby explains that he was caught for using drugs but he had gotten a hold of so much that she is also convinced that he was selling.</li> <li>[14:40] - For online scams, the goal is to receive money and the manipulation is a means to an end.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethical hacking may seem like an oxymoron, but having someone that you trust do a penetration test on your network may shock you. Our guest today has been helping people for 20 years to know when they’re vulnerable, and he shares his stories and insights to help you keep your information secure.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Brian Self. Brian is a certified Information Systems Security professional, ethical hacker, and professional speaker. He has the unique ability to take a complicated topic like network security and make it easy for a wide audience to understand. He has been in Information Security for over 15 years and in IT for over 20. He is a professional penetration tester doing offensive security, a compliance subject matter expert, an IT security architect, a security engineer, and a consultant in a variety of security domains.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:10] - Brian shares his background and how he got into the field of IT and security including the story that inspired him to get into ethical hacking.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:34] -In 15 minutes, a penetration tester taught Brian more about the system he was using than he ever knew was there. He was hooked from then on.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:37] - Brian defines some common hacking terminology in easy-to-understand verbiage.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:12] - In Brian’s experience, many people tell him that they don’t have anything of value that a hacker would want. He clarifies that everyone has something that can make them a target, including things you just don’t think of as a vulnerability.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:01] - In addition to white hat, gray hat, and black hat hackers, Brian explains the different teams of hackers called blue teams and red teams.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:43] - For penetration tests that Brian does, he doesn’t necessarily avoid getting caught.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:29] - Chris shares his experience with a penetration testing company and the surprise of what they found.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:52] - Brian confirms that Chris’s experience is very common. There are a lot of old systems in place that may have been secure when created but haven’t been updated.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:21] - Brian describes one of his very first pen tests and the ease of finding vulnerability.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:48] - For pen testers out there who are just starting, here’s a rule of thumb, never tell how you got in until you’re done. Brian explains why.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:58] - If you are approached by someone who claims to have found vulnerability, like a grey hat hacker, Brian advises to be very careful and to get a legal team involved.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:02] - Brian is motivated to help people understand security.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:38] - Responsible disclosure is when a security researcher gives companies ample time to make changes to their vulnerability. Some security researchers disclose the information on social media.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:33] - Brian suggests starting with the basics first before hiring someone to do penetration testing. Are you patching? If not, patch first.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:04] - If you’re starting from scratch, you can plan for changes in security. Consider who needs access to certain data.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:21] - Chris describes the balance that needs to be found between automated systems and human error.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:01] - Brian started learning social engineering when he had to convince someone to send him to an event to learn more.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:10] - Brian highly recommends the</span> <a href="https://owasp.org/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">OWASP foundation</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">to continue learning about penetration testing and overall security.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:14] - Chris admits that he has been nervous to attend conventions and explains his reasoning.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[31:15] - Chris references a</span> <a href= "https://www.easyprey.com/penetration-testing-and-ethical-hacking-with-ed-skoudis/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">previous episode with Ed Skoudis</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and an experience he had with the Holiday Hack Challenge.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:17] - Brian suggests taking classes, courses, and learning what you can. He says that if you take a course with Ed Skoudis, you are really learning.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:09] - In regards to risk, Brian keeps two main points - the likelihood and the impact.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:15] - Engage with the pen test team. Don’t wait to ask questions. Leverage them while you have their time and attention.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:55] - Make sure you have some proof from pen testers so you know how you fixed something without having to track down the pen testers later. You need a detailed report with priorities.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[36:13] - There are some companies that are now specializing in fixing risks. Brian is cautious of this because of an apparent conflict of interest.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[37:34] - It should be negotiated in your contract with a pen test to come back and retest.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[38:38] - Brian describes how he became burnt out with pen testing.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[40:00] - Many companies only hired pen test companies for compliance reasons. There are other companies who actually care about risk management. Brian explains that the types of testing he did varied due to the company’s reason.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[42:04] - What are the things that every security professional always tells people? Two-factor authorization is annoying but it is crucial.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[44:01] - Chris and Brian discuss SMS two-factor authorization. Brian explains that for most of us, it is enough. But for some, it isn’t.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[45:47] - Brian says that passwords need to be as complex as possible and at least 15 characters long.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[46:22] - Comparing two-factor authorization to a home break-in, Brian illustrates that something is better than nothing.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[48:16] - Do not use the same password on multiple accounts. You need to have extra security for the accounts that are of value.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[49:18] - If you’re not going to take the steps for everything, apply it where you really</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">need</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">to, like bank accounts.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[50:08] - Pen tests give companies a lot of assurance, but in a lot of cases it takes away assurance.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[51:04] - A lot of times, security becomes a chore for a lot of companies.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[52:30] - Brian shares a personal story of hackers contacting one of his clients in an attempt to gain access to her network.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[54:07] - One major suggestion that Brian makes to everyone is to block out automatic image loading in emails.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

If not, patch first.</li> <li>[23:04] - If you’re starting from scratch, you can plan for changes in security. Consider who needs access to certain data.</li> <li>[24:21] - Chris describes the balance that needs to be found between automated systems and human error.</li> <li>[26:01] - Brian started learning social engineering when he had to convince someone to send him to an event to learn more.</li> <li>[27:10] - Brian highly recommends the <a href="https://owasp.org/">OWASP foundation</a> to continue learning about penetration testing and overall security.</li> <li>[29:14] - Chris admits that he has been nervous to attend conventions and explains his reasoning.</li> <li>[31:15] - Chris references a <a href= "https://www.easyprey.com/penetration-testing-and-ethical-hacking-with-ed-skoudis/"> previous episode with Ed Skoudis</a> and an experience he had with the Holiday Hack Challenge.</li> <li>[32:17] - Brian suggests taking classes, courses, and learning what you can. He says that if you take a course with Ed Skoudis, you are really learning.</li> <li>[33:09] - In regards to risk, Brian keeps two main points - the likelihood and the impact.</li> <li>[34:15] - Engage with the pen test team. Don’t wait to ask questions. Leverage them while you have their time and attention.</li> <li>[34:55] - Make sure you have some proof from pen testers so you know how you fixed something without having to track down the pen testers later. You need a detailed report with priorities.</li> <li>[36:13] - There are some companies that are now specializing in fixing risks. Brian is cautious of this because of an apparent conflict of interest.</li> <li>[37:34] - It should be negotiated in your contract with a pen test to come back and retest.</li> <li>[38:38] - Brian describes how he became burnt out with pen testing.</li> <li>[40:00] - Many companies only hired pen test companies for compliance reasons. There are other companies who actually care about risk management. Brian explains that the types of testing he did varied due to the company’s reason.</li> <li>[42:04] - What are the things that every security professional always tells people? Two-factor authorization is annoying but it is crucial.</li> <li>[44:01] - Chris and Brian discuss SMS two-factor authorization. Brian explains that for most of us, it is enough. But for some, it isn’t.</li> <li>[45:47] - Brian says that passwords need to be as complex as possible and at least 15 characters long.</li> <li>[46:22] - Comparing two-factor authorization to a home break-in, Brian illustrates that something is better than nothing.</li> <li>[48:16] - Do not use the same password on multiple accounts. You need to have extra security for the accounts that are of value.</li> <li>[49:18] - If you’re not going to take the steps for everything, apply it where you really <em>need</em> to, like bank accounts.</li> <li>[50:08] - Pen tests give companies a lot of assurance, but in a lot of cases it takes away assurance.</li> <li>[51:04] - A lot of times, security becomes a chore for a lot of companies.</li> <li>[52:30] - Brian shares a personal story of hackers contacting one of his clients in an attempt to gain access to her network.</li> <li>[54:07] - One major suggestion that Brian makes to everyone is to block out automatic image loading in emails.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seniors are prime targets for cyber crime because many of them have been preparing for retirement and have sizable savings. Their lack of familiarity with technology can set them up to be deceived or hacked. Scammers are going to elaborate lengths to hide their deception. It's important to be aware of their schemes.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Scott Schober. Scott is the CEO of Berkeley Varitronics Systems. As a cyber security and wireless technology expert, Scott has had regular appearances on Bloomberg TV, ABC, CBS, FOX News, Good Morning America, CNN, CNBC, and many more. Scott is the author of</span> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Hacked-Again-Scott-N-Schober/dp/099690221X"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hacked Again</span></em></a><em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">,</span></em> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Cybersecurity-Everybodys-Business-Security-Puzzle/dp/0996902260"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyber Security is Everybody’s Business</span></em></a><em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">,</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">and his latest book, we’ll talk about today,</span> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Senior-Cyber-Security-Practices-Golden/dp/1736315803"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior Cyber</span></em></a><em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></em></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:10] - Senior Cyber is a little different than Scott’s other books. Scott was inspired to write it as he has helped his parents and grandparents with technology.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:22] - As he was looking for resources for his parents and grandparents, he found that the books tended to talk down to the audience. It makes the audience feel intimidated.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:36] - Typically, seniors have a little bit more disposable income because they’re saving for retirement. It makes them targets of scams. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:09] - Scott points out that seniors also tend to be more innocent and naive when it comes to trusting hackers. Hackers can more easily use phishing attacks.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:41] - Chris and Scott discuss the familiarity gap between generations. Bringing in terms like cryptocurrency and bitcoin is a way that confuses older generations.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:23] - There are many seniors who have taken the time to learn, become comfortable with, and embrace technology including online bill pay and communication. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:27] - Scott shares how he has heard from some readers of his book who said that through reading the book, it opened younger family members up to helping older family members navigate online.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:18] - Chris shares an experience with a friend who’s father went missing which caused Chris to really start thinking about his own parents and led to a great conversation with them.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:23] - Scott describes a similar story of his daughter seemingly going missing while on a trip many years ago. Technology didn’t enter their mind as a solution, but now it can be helpful in making sure others are safe.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:00] - Using his own father as an example, many seniors who have a brilliant mind, feel discouraged because they can’t always remember usernames, passwords, and processes to stay safe online.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:20] - Imagine someone who has never used computers, listening to current buzzwords like phishing attacks, encryption, ransomware, etc.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:01] - Making it clear that seniors are not inherently doing anything wrong, communicating cyber security strategies in a way that is relatable to them is key.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:53] - In his experience, Scott sees most seniors accessing the internet through a computer and typically have their passwords written down in plain view. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:10] - Doing some “house cleaning” when it comes to cyber security for the seniors in your life can be very helpful. Remove unused apps and clean out things that aren’t necessary.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:38] - Scott shares a story about a credit card expiring and cutting it up. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:14] - Sharing stories with others can have a larger impact on those you are helping than making them feel like they are being lectured.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:04] - Scott explains that the scams that impact the elderly the most are always tied to emotions. Recently, there have been scams surrounding vaccines.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:09] - If something sounds a little fishy, pause and ask the questions.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:39] - Phone calls and emails asking for information to put you on a list for a vaccine are rampant right now.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:59] - Because it is also tax season, there are a lot of tax scams going on. Remember that the IRS is not going to call you.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:53] - Scott learns about a new scam every single day. It keeps changing and evolving. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:55] - When someone calls and volunteers a small amount of personal information about you asking for you to confirm the rest and tries to do so very quickly, those are red flags of a scam.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:37] - An older generation was taught to answer the phone because it is courteous while a younger generation may screen calls or prefer texts.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:56] - Even if a senior has a smartphone and attempts to screen calls, call spoofing is so easy for scammers to do. Scott shares how he tried it himself and demonstrates just how easy it is.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[31:40] - Scott points out that seniors are more likely to respond to calls which causes them to keep calling and probing for more information.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:42] - Scott shares a personal story about his grandfather becoming a victim to a scam.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:26] - Fortunately in the case of his grandfather, the cashier performing the wire transfers knew of a scam and asked questions.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[35:19] - Once a scam is successful, even more calls and emails will come to try to scam again.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[37:05] - Some scammers will also try to coach you to lie to cashiers or banks. That is a red flag. You shouldn’t have to lie to access your funds.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[39:47] - Chris shares that some people he has helped, especially if they are older, tend to think that they are personally targeted. But it is really that everyone is targeted and a lot of people get the same calls.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[41:18] - Scott describes how he was able to talk with a scammer and how when he got caught, he became extremely angry.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[43:59] - When Chris and Scott answer these calls and talk to scammers knowing what they are trying to do, they are at least gaining knowledge on how they operate.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[45:26] - Chris explains a newer scam called brushing in, which is when packages are delivered to you that you did not order to cause you to reach out and give information to get the package to the right person.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[47:53] - Scott’s book,</span> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Senior-Cyber-Security-Practices-Golden/dp/1736315803"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior Cyber</span></em></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is available on Amazon and his website.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[49:24] - Throughout the book, there are “Senior Tips” that bullet point quick tips and facts that are easy to understand. There is also a senior workbook that is enjoyable and educational. You can reach out to Scott to receive one of those.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some believe Ponzi schemes are doomed to fail. But with a sophisticated schemer and a broad enough base of people, they might just be able to keep it going.

Steve admits that it is very hard to explain and that is the key to a Ponzi scheme.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:45] - Schemers blamed their victims for falling for the scheme. They claimed that they deserved what happened because they weren’t smart enough.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:58] - Steve describes how Charles Ponzi used the money from investors and shares why a more recent scheme in 2008 was successful.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:46] - In the case of Charles Ponzi, law enforcement didn’t bring him down. The media did.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:29] - Ponzi did spend time in prison and was kicked out of the country. He went back to Italy and actually scammed Mussolini.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:04] - Ponzi was probably not the first person to scam this way. In Steve’s research, there was an earlier scam by a woman named Sarah Howe in the 1870s.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:42] - Upon being released from prison, Sarah went back to her old ways and developed the same exact scam.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:16] - Steve shares the story of Brad Bleidt to illustrate the term “affinity fraud.” Brad was a Mason and other Masonic groups trusted him.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:01] - Sarah Howe targeted women. Brad Bleidt targeted other Masons. Bernie Madoff targeted mostly other Jewish people. We trust those who are like us.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:21] - Steve shares a story about how Bernie Madoff was actually found out much earlier and reported multiple times.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:10] - This is not just an American phenomenon. A massive Ponzi scheme in Romania took down most of the nation’s economy.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:43] - When you deal with any kind of investment, you want to check out two things. The first thing is the person you’re dealing with. The second thing is to fully understand what you’re investing in.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:28] - People like Madoff and Bleidt would be an investment advisor and the person who holds the investment. Most of the time, you want your investment advisor and custodian as separate people.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:13] - Chris asks a new question of the guest and Steve says it is a</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">very</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">important question. Do these schemes start out as frauds to begin with or do they evolve into it?</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:10] - Some schemers don’t start out that way. They need a little bit more money or time and before they know it, they’re in too deep.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:03] - Steve points out that Bernie Madoff may have been able to get away with his scheme forever if it weren’t for the unprecedented economic issues in 2008.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:42] - Bernie Madoff was never actually</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">caught</span></em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">. He knew he was about to be caught and turned himself in. Steve shares the interesting facts of the case and where the money wound up.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:29] - Ultimately, the money invested with Madoff was able to be returned to investors. But this is unusual. Most of the time, the money is dissipated.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:08] - Ponzi schemers will appear very successful and wealthy when in reality they are dissipating the funds that they get to appear that way.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:35] - In addition to living lavish lifestyles, some schemers may have issues with gambling.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:23] - Steve shares the story of a Ponzi schemer in Florida who was a lawyer. He was a fixture of the high life in South Florida.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[30:24] - There was a Texas scammer that owned a bank in the Caribbean selling CDs at high rates. Rather than Ponzi, this was similar to Madoff’s approach.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:01] - Chris and Steve discuss the regulatory organizations that are intended to investigate Ponzi schemes.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:18] - If you feel like you are a victim of a Ponzi scheme, you need to report it to the SEC or the Federal Trade Commision. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[35:10] - Investing all of your money into one thing is not a good idea, either. The markets go up and down. Diversification as much as possible is helpful.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[36:01] - Steve references the recent GameStop stock that appeared to be a “pump and dump” scam but was not.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[38:40] - You have to do your homework on investments. No one likes to do the research and the homework, but it can be detrimental if you do not.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[39:53] - In reference to the GameStop stock, Steve explains that when investors were “sticking it to the man,” they were impacting hedge funds.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[41:05] - Steve is a big believer in investing but clarifies that day trading is not investing, but rather gambling.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[43:03] - Chris and Steve sum up the red flags to look for to avoid being a victim of a Ponzi scheme.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of us would not consider ourselves to be an easy target for a predator. But we may be communicating signs that we’re unaware of. Today’s guest is Mike Mandel.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike’s career has covered many different fields from stage performer, trainer, psycho-therapist, martial arts instructor, writer, and corporate speaker. Mike is a renowned hypnotist with 18 nominations and 6 awards for excellence in entertainment and is also considered an expert in the unique martial art of British Jiu Jitsu. He has trained both law enforcement and security personnel and boasts a diverse client list that includes Microsoft, Scotia Bank, and the Department of Defense. He has been featured on both British and Australian television, profiled in numerous publications including Martial Arts Illustrated, I Spy Magazine, and Toronto Star.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:07] - Mike shares his background as a hypnotist and training in British Jiu Jitsu. He is a forensic hypnotist that works on murder cases and has spoken at colleges and universities.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:03] - When he was younger, Mike admits that he was far too trusting. He went into business with a business partner who turned out to be a psychopath.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:09] - Before the issues with his business partner were revealed, Mike had an experience on a plane with him getting suddenly angry about his handwriting. Now, as a graphologist, Mike knows now that his writing was a clue.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:51] - After dealing with overwhelming stress, Mike reached out to a friend and former colleague who is a forensic psychiatrist who said that he was taken in by a highly functioning psychopath.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:46] - This experience led Mike to studying psychopathy and he now does lectures on the topic, specifically signs in handwriting.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:30] - The terms psychopath and sociopath are used synonymously.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:01] - Mike shares that there are many psychopaths who are immensely successful and some are in the armed forces. Generally speaking, they can rise to the top with ease because they don’t have the same fears as an average person.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:52] - Mike describes psychopaths as grandiose and good at luring people into their presentation.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:23] - There was a study done on psychopaths in the prison system where they were shown the same video of random people walking on the street and asked who they would target. They all chose the same person.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:18] - Psychopaths are very good at hiding their true selves and are extremely patient in waiting for their opportunity.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:27] - Psychopaths are so good at what they do. Mike shares that he has known detectives and psychiatrists who have been fooled.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:30] - Mike doesn’t think that psychopathy can be “fixed” as their brains simply do not process things the same way.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:02] - Almost every scam that Chris has heard of has some sort of emotional connection.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:19] - We need close friends in our lives, but the scary thing for Mike was that the psychopath that tricked Mike</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">was</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">a close friend.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:45] - The first tip Mike has is to be aware of your surroundings at all times. This awareness is also important in your online surroundings.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:18] - Mike shares a story about what he calls his “spider sense.” </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:02] - Mike describes a color system he has that illustrates a way to condition yourself in being cautious and aware of your surroundings.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:31] - The Witching Hour is a window of time between 11:00pm and 3:00am that your chances of being in a violent encounter are higher than other times of the day and night.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:50] - We don’t want to be paranoid, because if our spider senses are set too high then real problems are indistinguishable from the background.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:11] - Mike describes self defense versus self protection.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:40] - While in public, Mike is always assessing situations and never putting himself into a position that someone could surprise him.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:14] - You want to make it that it is an unconscious response.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[30:07] - Mike describes the different proximities and how safety comes through distance.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:17] - When asked about the prisoner study where psychopaths would pick the same people to target, Mike shares that one of the things they picked up on was an asymmetrical walk. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:51] - Mike describes how our level of confidence is apparent in our body language and many people seem to have a target on them because of, what Mike calls, a “victim signal.”</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:45] - Avoid everything and every place if it doesn’t feel right.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[35:52] - Chris and Mike make the connection between real-life and online targeting.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[37:01] - They use the psychological trick of appealing to scarcity and urgency. We are all vulnerable to these things even if we know about them.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[40:20] - Mike shares a story about an experience with his online business being harassed by a client.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[41:12] - The way you disconnect from someone is to ignore and disconnect them. If you tell them over and over again that you’re not going to communicate, you are in fact communicating with them.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[42:44] - Get toxic people out of your life. When you see signs of someone in your life that you feel are “off,” you need to be prepared to fire people out of your life.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[43:47] - Mike explains how the traits in the writing of the psychopath that was in his life stood out to him and shares how specific features look.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[45:08] - The “Felon’s Claw” is a trait of handwriting that indicates that someone feels guilty.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[47:37] - Mike’s final piece of advice is that you can’t change a psychopath and you will likely come across one in your life. The revenge that we have as healthy, functional people is to not obsess over them.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

Now, as a graphologist, Mike knows now that his writing was a clue.</li> <li>[4:51] - After dealing with overwhelming stress, Mike reached out to a friend and former colleague who is a forensic psychiatrist who said that he was taken in by a highly functioning psychopath.</li> <li>[5:46] - This experience led Mike to studying psychopathy and he now does lectures on the topic, specifically signs in handwriting.</li> <li>[6:30] - The terms psychopath and sociopath are used synonymously.</li> <li>[7:01] - Mike shares that there are many psychopaths who are immensely successful and some are in the armed forces. Generally speaking, they can rise to the top with ease because they don’t have the same fears as an average person.</li> <li>[7:52] - Mike describes psychopaths as grandiose and good at luring people into their presentation.</li> <li>[8:23] - There was a study done on psychopaths in the prison system where they were shown the same video of random people walking on the street and asked who they would target. They all chose the same person.</li> <li>[9:18] - Psychopaths are very good at hiding their true selves and are extremely patient in waiting for their opportunity.</li> <li>[10:27] - Psychopaths are so good at what they do. Mike shares that he has known detectives and psychiatrists who have been fooled.</li> <li>[11:30] - Mike doesn’t think that psychopathy can be “fixed” as their brains simply do not process things the same way.</li> <li>[13:02] - Almost every scam that Chris has heard of has some sort of emotional connection.</li> <li>[14:19] - We need close friends in our lives, but the scary thing for Mike was that the psychopath that tricked Mike <em>was</em> a close friend.</li> <li>[15:45] - The first tip Mike has is to be aware of your surroundings at all times. This awareness is also important in your online surroundings.</li> <li>[17:18] - Mike shares a story about what he calls his “spider sense.” </li> <li>[18:02] - Mike describes a color system he has that illustrates a way to condition yourself in being cautious and aware of your surroundings.</li> <li>[20:31] - The Witching Hour is a window of time between 11:00pm and 3:00am that your chances of being in a violent encounter are higher than other times of the day and night.</li> <li>[22:50] - We don’t want to be paranoid, because if our spider senses are set too high then real problems are indistinguishable from the background.</li> <li>[25:11] - Mike describes self defense versus self protection.</li> <li>[27:40] - While in public, Mike is always assessing situations and never putting himself into a position that someone could surprise him.</li> <li>[29:14] - You want to make it that it is an unconscious response.</li> <li>[30:07] - Mike describes the different proximities and how safety comes through distance.</li> <li>[32:17] - When asked about the prisoner study where psychopaths would pick the same people to target, Mike shares that one of the things they picked up on was an asymmetrical walk. </li> <li>[33:51] - Mike describes how our level of confidence is apparent in our body language and many people seem to have a target on them because of, what Mike calls, a “victim signal.”</li> <li>[34:45] - Avoid everything and every place if it doesn’t feel right.</li> <li>[35:52] - Chris and Mike make the connection between real-life and online targeting.</li> <li>[37:01] - They use the psychological trick of appealing to scarcity and urgency. We are all vulnerable to these things even if we know about them.</li> <li>[40:20] - Mike shares a story about an experience with his online business being harassed by a client.</li> <li>[41:12] - The way you disconnect from someone is to ignore and disconnect them. If you tell them over and over again that you’re not going to communicate, you are in fact communicating with them.</li> <li>[42:44] - Get toxic people out of your life. When you see signs of someone in your life that you feel are “off,” you need to be prepared to fire people out of your life.</li> <li>[43:47] - Mike explains how the traits in the writing of the psychopath that was in his life stood out to him and shares how specific features look.</li> <li>[45:08] - The “Felon’s Claw” is a trait of handwriting that indicates that someone feels guilty.</li> <li>[47:37] - Mike’s final piece of advice is that you can’t change a psychopath and you will likely come across one in your life. The revenge that we have as healthy, functional people is to not obsess over them.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data privacy has often been an after-thought in software and platform development. Data breaches have increased consumer awareness and laws such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) have been enacted. Programmers and engineers need to think about what data they are collecting, how it is being stored and accessed, and how it is shared to protect their end users. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Nishant Bhajaria. Nishant leads the technical privacy and strategy teams for Uber that include data scientists, engineers, privacy experts, and others as they seek to improve data privacy for the consumers and the company. Previously, he worked in compliance, data protection and privacy at Google. He was also the head of privacy engineering at Netflix. He is a well-known expert in the field of data privacy, has developed numerous courses on the topic, and has spoken extensively at conferences and on podcasts.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:09] - Nishant shares his background and how he got started in the field of data privacy. He started at Intel and explains the changes in data collection in the early 2010s.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:47] - Nishant started in the field “before it was cool,” because of his strengths as an engineer and writer.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:33] - GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation and Nishant describes what this law means and how it came about in Europe.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:47] - CCPA is the US’s approach and first step into data privacy laws.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:53] - Consent is going to be a big topic in 2021. Nishant describes how the events of the last decade have led to data privacy laws.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:56] - Nishant points out that a problem with data privacy laws as they stand right now is that they are not written by people who have the technological and engineering background.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:39] - The data privacy issues that have arisen in recent years did not happen all of a sudden. Nishant explains that many mistakes across the board have led to them.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:00] - Nishant lists some of the conundrums and ethical questions that come up when discussing data privacy.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:23] - One of the biggest problems with data privacy is the different understanding of what that means. European countries and the United States do not have the same understanding of what privacy is.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:46] - Security features exist for very good reasons, but people are generally very impatient with them.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:12] - Nishant gives an example of microdecisions that come in to play when data gets into the hands of the wrong person.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:17] - Nishant gives an example of how some decisions, made by companies in response to GDPR, are making sure they are in compliance but are not always consumer friendly due to a lack of understanding of the law.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:56] - The internet was not designed with privacy in mind. Privacy was an afterthought.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:06] - Nishant describes the challenges that we face when consumers want to access apps and sites quickly and the domino effect that takes place.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:29] - There was a huge systemic change in the workforce in the field of data privacy and data collection that Nishant describes was due to most people joining this career after 2009.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:43] - A problem arose when engineers would think that they were always the ethical ones because they were collecting data or designing apps and platforms to collect data for the right reasons. But that isn’t always how that data is used. More to Nishant’s point that data collection needs to be regulated from the get go.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:03] - Privacy is all about not accessing or using data without the owner’s consent, but people don’t realize how much can be known about someone just with combining easily accessible data online.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:10] - We have built the internet for fast access and use. Customers sign up for a lot of access to sites and apps and don’t think about the use of their data when they do.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:31] - For companies that are small and don’t have the legal teams to handle a privacy problem, Nishant says the first thing to do is to make sure you really need the information you are asking for from your customers.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:27] - It is much easier to look at what you’re collecting, the necessity of it all, and how that data could be compromised in the early stages because there’s not a lot of data to dig into.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:06] - Another tip from Nishant is to lean on tooling to build privacy at scale. He describes what this means with examples.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:36] - Nishant also explains to make sure that the wall between the legal team and the engineering/privacy team is broken down. Those teams need to work in harmony.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:10] - Chris and Nishant discuss the pitfalls of deleting data and the importance of consistency.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[31:07] - Many companies cannot afford to go through a data breach or legal problem with data privacy.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:10] - There is an economical factor to consider when collecting too much data or duplicate data that Nishant describes.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:18] - When signing up for services, sites, or apps, consider why they are asking for the data they say they need. A social security number, for example, is not needed for a grocery delivery.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[36:01] - As a result of the GDPR, companies are starting to be required to disclose the information of what consumers’ data is used for.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[36:28] - Nishant says that the biggest piece of advice he has for consumers is to always ask questions. At the end of the day, it is your data and you need to know what’s happening with it.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[37:56] - Apple specifically has built a really strong privacy standard for other companies to live up to. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[40:01] - This time of Covid and the US’s political events have changed the landscape of privacy and data collection and through this crisis, Nishant is confident that great ideas and positive change come through times of unrest.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[41:37] - Regulators and lawmakers need the engineering support and need to be a part of our conversations regarding data privacy.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[43:24] - Nishant hasn’t met anyone that has thought that privacy is unimportant, but communicating the details and the prioritization is a different challenge.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[45:16] -</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy by Design</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is Nishant’s book written to educate business owners, engineers, and CEOs that privacy is taken care of at the start instead of as an afterthought as a response to a problem.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[47:31] - Regardless of your current understanding of technology, Nishant’s book is a great read to better understand privacy and data collection.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catfishing is when a person creates a fake identity often with corresponding social media accounts, phone numbers, photos, and addresses targeting a specific victim for abuse or fraud. These catfishers are organized, patient, and have a playbook that they follow to gain the trust of their target over the course of weeks, months, or even years. Effective deceviers even get advice from other scammers on how to proceed for their own success.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is David McClellan. David was an internet marketer and website builder for over ten years. He ran and executed SEO strategies for CNET where he added 1.4 billion visitors to the portfolio. He branched out as a visionary and entrepreneur 6 years ago when he created SocialCatfish.com. His website became the fastest growing company in Riverside, California and is an Inc 500 company.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:10] - David shares his background as an internet marketer turned entrepreneur and the start of SocialCatfish.com.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:01] - He and his business partner used to build websites and then flip them but discovered that there was no resource out there regarding catfishing.

She had been secluded from her friends and family and the scammer even told her to commit suicide.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:29] - Effective scammers will seclude a victim from their friends and family using a convincing story and are very emotionally manipulative.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:50] - A newer trend in romance scams is that scammers are now starting to send inexpensive gifts to victims such as balloons, flowers, and cheap jewelry to build trust.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:51] - When interviewing scammers, David asks them what happens if they don’t get money and the answer is that they</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">always</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">get money.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Catfishing is when a person creates a fake identity often with corresponding social media accounts, phone numbers, photos, and addresses targeting a specific victim for abuse or fraud.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many are resigned to stay silent about the pain of being scammed, but today’s guest helps empower others by vulnerably communicating her experience and sharing specific warning signs.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Debby Montgomery Johnson. Debby is founder of The Woman Behind the Smile, Inc. She is a best-selling author, international speaker, entrepreneur, podcast host, former Air Force officer who served at the Pentagon, and is a woman on a mission. In her book</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Woman Behind the Smile,</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">she shares her personal experience with a love that turned to betrayal and financial disaster. She removes the mask of shame and shows others how to do the same. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:07] - Debby shares the person she was before she was scammed. Her husband of 26 years had unexpectedly passed away, she had a varied career background, and is a mother and grandmother.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:08] - After her husband passed away, she had to step up and run his business without a lot of training or knowledge.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:05] - Debby had very little time to grieve as she would work her job and then go straight into managing her late husband’s business.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:59] - When her friends noticed that she was staying home so much to work on the business, they told her she needed to get out and “have a life.” A friend recommended online dating.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:56] - Debby was very transparent in her online dating profile. She stepped into it very carefully.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:46] - Although Debby was very particular, she did eventually meet someone who caught her attention and that’s how everything started.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:43] - Debby explains that something that scammers do is try to take you off the dating sites to talk and Debby would talk to him on Yahoo Chat instead.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:39] - After speaking with a psychologist later on, Debby was told that she likely never felt listened to based on her behaviors and she admits that Eric, the man she met online,</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">did</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">listen to her.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:47] - Over two years of communicating with Eric, Debby felt listened to and shares that she had wonderful conversations through writing with him.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:22] - At this point in time, Debby was familiar with online dating scams and never felt like anything sinister was going on.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:23] - Debby began lending money to Eric as a way to help him through his jobs until he would get paid. He always promised to pay her back. The energy came from the sooner he finished a job, the sooner he would come home.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:01] - The first red flag for Debby was when he asked her to set up a power of attorney and use Western Union to send him money.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:43] - In addition to asking for money, Eric also was successful in further isolating Debby from her friends and family. Debby shares how her sons warned her against a relationship with Eric.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:50] - After being married for so long, Debby wasn’t ready for a physical relationship, but she was ready for a friendship. Eric turned into a confidante.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:59] - Debby explains how she wanted to video chat with Eric but that he always had an excuse as to why he couldn’t get online to do that.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:13] - Eric continued to ask Debby for money for his issues with his international business. Looking back, she shares that it all seems so ridiculous but the urgency was overpowering.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:01] - Debby admits that she did not have the large sums of money Eric needed and she dipped into retirement funds, sold jewelry, and even borrowed a very large sum from her parents.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:47] - When asked if she would go back and change things if she could, Debby says she would actually let things happen the way they happened. She learned so much about herself during this time and is now able to help others.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:36] - Chris shares a story that illustrates the lack of knowledge surrounding scams and security.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:28] - When you think of an online romance scam, you’ll think ‘oh that will never happen to me.’ That’s not the point. It could happen to your mother, your daughter, or your best friend.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:31] - Other victims that have been scammed reach out to Debby after reading her book and Debby has noticed that everyone’s story is exactly the same. These scammers are very well trained.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:59] - Debby’s sons were very upset after the scam was revealed, but they also felt that they had not done their job to protect their mother as well.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[30:54] - Eric and Debby had a lengthy conversation about forgiveness and he confessed that it all had been a scam.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:13] - Initially Debby didn’t believe Eric and asked for proof that it was a scam. They finally conducted a video chat and she saw the real person behind it all.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:09] - Eric admitted that throughout the scam, he had started to feel real feelings for Debby and had to come clean. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:30] - Debby went to the FBI and they told her that there was nothing they could do because he was not in the country.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[36:04] - She told a new friend her story and through their conversation she discovered that the other woman’s mother was also scammed. That was the moment Debby realized that she had a mission now.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[38:14] - Debby was put in contact with an organization called Society of Citizens Against Relationship Scams that has been working with victims and survivors all over the world.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[41:08] - Chris and Debby discuss other popular scams that are happening that drain a lot of money from individuals and businesses.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[43:02] - Chris references a past episode that also proved that many victims and survivors don’t report things because of the embarrassment of being scammed.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[45:01] - A friend of Debby’s is now dating online and Debby shares that she can spot a scammer very quickly now and objectively helps her friend navigate different profiles.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[47:36] - Many men have had their pictures used by scammers. And sometimes they are able to contact people who have been communicating with a scammer through their likeness and convince them that it is a scam.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[49:03] - Debby and Chris discuss why many scammers use the likeness of people in the military. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[51:10] - The first people you need to tell if you’ve been scammed this way is your family so you can have support and be surrounded by people who love you.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[53:45] - Something more recent that is happening with the onset of more available video chat platforms is now scammers can steal videos and voice over to provide more convincing communication.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[56:01] - All different age groups are hit by romance scams in different ways. Older generations are more reliant on Skype and Facetime but the younger generations are using different mobile apps like Snapchat and Instagram.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[56:32] - When making a dating profile, do not list that you are widowed or divorced. It may make you a target.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[57:35] - Don’t put your business or any way to look up your finances on your dating profile.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[58:21] - Pictures used in profiles can also be red flags.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many are resigned to stay silent about the pain of being scammed, but today’s guest helps empower others by vulnerably communicating her experience and sharing specific warning signs.</p> <p>Today’s guest is Debby Montgomery Johnson. Debby is founder of The Woman Behind the Smile, Inc. She is a best-selling author, international speaker, entrepreneur, podcast host, former Air Force officer who served at the Pentagon, and is a woman on a mission. In her book <em>The Woman Behind the Smile,</em> she shares her personal experience with a love that turned to betrayal and financial disaster. She removes the mask of shame and shows others how to do the same. </p> Show Notes: <ul> <li>[1:07] - Debby shares the person she was before she was scammed. Her husband of 26 years had unexpectedly passed away, she had a varied career background, and is a mother and grandmother.</li> <li>[2:08] - After her husband passed away, she had to step up and run his business without a lot of training or knowledge.</li> <li>[3:05] - Debby had very little time to grieve as she would work her job and then go straight into managing her late husband’s business.</li> <li>[3:59] - When her friends noticed that she was staying home so much to work on the business, they told her she needed to get out and “have a life.” A friend recommended online dating.</li> <li>[4:56] - Debby was very transparent in her online dating profile. She stepped into it very carefully.</li> <li>[5:46] - Although Debby was very particular, she did eventually meet someone who caught her attention and that’s how everything started.</li> <li>[6:43] - Debby explains that something that scammers do is try to take you off the dating sites to talk and Debby would talk to him on Yahoo Chat instead.</li> <li>[8:39] - After speaking with a psychologist later on, Debby was told that she likely never felt listened to based on her behaviors and she admits that Eric, the man she met online, <em>did</em> listen to her.</li> <li>[9:47] - Over two years of communicating with Eric, Debby felt listened to and shares that she had wonderful conversations through writing with him.</li> <li>[11:22] - At this point in time, Debby was familiar with online dating scams and never felt like anything sinister was going on.</li> <li>[12:23] - Debby began lending money to Eric as a way to help him through his jobs until he would get paid. He always promised to pay her back. The energy came from the sooner he finished a job, the sooner he would come home.</li> <li>[14:01] - The first red flag for Debby was when he asked her to set up a power of attorney and use Western Union to send him money.</li> <li>[15:43] - In addition to asking for money, Eric also was successful in further isolating Debby from her friends and family. Debby shares how her sons warned her against a relationship with Eric.</li> <li>[17:50] - After being married for so long, Debby wasn’t ready for a physical relationship, but she was ready for a friendship. Eric turned into a confidante.</li> <li>[18:59] - Debby explains how she wanted to video chat with Eric but that he always had an excuse as to why he couldn’t get online to do that.</li> <li>[20:13] - Eric continued to ask Debby for money for his issues with his international business. Looking back, she shares that it all seems so ridiculous but the urgency was overpowering.</li> <li>[21:01] - Debby admits that she did not have the large sums of money Eric needed and she dipped into retirement funds, sold jewelry, and even borrowed a very large sum from her parents.</li> <li>[23:47] - When asked if she would go back and change things if she could, Debby says she would actually let things happen the way they happened. She learned so much about herself during this time and is now able to help others.</li> <li>[25:36] - Chris shares a story that illustrates the lack of knowledge surrounding scams and security.</li> <li>[27:28] - When you think of an online romance scam, you’ll think ‘oh that will never happen to me.’ That’s not the point. It could happen to your mother, your daughter, or your best friend.</li> <li>[28:31] - Other victims that have been scammed reach out to Debby after reading her book and Debby has noticed that everyone’s story is exactly the same. These scammers are very well trained.</li> <li>[29:59] - Debby’s sons were very upset after the scam was revealed, but they also felt that they had not done their job to protect their mother as well.</li> <li>[30:54] - Eric and Debby had a lengthy conversation about forgiveness and he confessed that it all had been a scam.</li> <li>[32:13] - Initially Debby didn’t believe Eric and asked for proof that it was a scam. They finally conducted a video chat and she saw the real person behind it all.</li> <li>[33:09] - Eric admitted that throughout the scam, he had started to feel real feelings for Debby and had to come clean. </li> <li>[34:30] - Debby went to the FBI and they told her that there was nothing they could do because he was not in the country.</li> <li>[36:04] - She told a new friend her story and through their conversation she discovered that the other woman’s mother was also scammed. That was the moment Debby realized that she had a mission now.</li> <li>[38:14] - Debby was put in contact with an organization called Society of Citizens Against Relationship Scams that has been working with victims and survivors all over the world.</li> <li>[41:08] - Chris and Debby discuss other popular scams that are happening that drain a lot of money from individuals and businesses.</li> <li>[43:02] - Chris references a past episode that also proved that many victims and survivors don’t report things because of the embarrassment of being scammed.</li> <li>[45:01] - A friend of Debby’s is now dating online and Debby shares that she can spot a scammer very quickly now and objectively helps her friend navigate different profiles.</li> <li>[47:36] - Many men have had their pictures used by scammers. And sometimes they are able to contact people who have been communicating with a scammer through their likeness and convince them that it is a scam.</li> <li>[49:03] - Debby and Chris discuss why many scammers use the likeness of people in the military. </li> <li>[51:10] - The first people you need to tell if you’ve been scammed this way is your family so you can have support and be surrounded by people who love you.</li> <li>[53:45] - Something more recent that is happening with the onset of more available video chat platforms is now scammers can steal videos and voice over to provide more convincing communication.</li> <li>[56:01] - All different age groups are hit by romance scams in different ways. Older generations are more reliant on Skype and Facetime but the younger generations are using different mobile apps like Snapchat and Instagram.</li> <li>[56:32] - When making a dating profile, do not list that you are widowed or divorced. It may make you a target.</li> <li>[57:35] - Don’t put your business or any way to look up your finances on your dating profile.</li> <li>[58:21] - Pictures used in profiles can also be red flags. You can reverse Google the image and sometimes find that they’re photos of a model or stock photo.</li> <li>[59:24] - If someone you are talking to is constantly international and can’t get home, that is a romance scam red flag.</li> <li>[60:11] - Currently, money is being sent to scammers through cryptocurrency, gift cards, or even gaming platform credit.</li> <li>[61:45] - If you think you might be involved in a scam or know someone who is, Debby recommends you check out Anyscam.com or AgainstScam.org.</li> <li>[62:47] - Debby says you need to report everything and take the time to write down your story to get it out. Find someone who you trust and can help you move forward.</li> <li>[64:09] - Another sad reality of romance scams is that victims shut themselves off from love and dating again and isolate themselves from potential positive relationships.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping children safe online is a concern for every parent. Children can have a technical skill that is far more advanced than their cognitive development and it is not easy to know how and what boundaries to set. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Susan McLean. Susan is Australia’s foremost expert in the area of cyber safety and was a member of Victoria Police for 27 years. Widely known as The Cyber Cop, she was the first Victoria police officer appointed to a position involving cyber safety and young people. In 2003, she was a Victoria Police Region 4 Youth Officer of the Year. She has also been awarded the National Medal and Victoria Police Service Medal. Susan established a consulting firm in March 2007 called Cyber Safety Solutions and has grown to be the most highly respected and in demand cyber safety consultancy in Australia.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Show Notes:</span></span></p> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:21] - Susan shares her background in law enforcement and her first online appointment was in 1994.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:17] - She was led to America in her quest to learn as much as she could about cyber safety. The training she was a part of was The Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Team training and more trainings in Texas.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:35] - When Susan returned to Australia, she outlined a plan of action for law enforcement in Australia.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:14] - When Susan’s support retired, she lost all internal support at that time. Others claimed she was making things up to create a job opportunity and that because she was a woman, she couldn’t do this job.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:07] - Susan quit her job because she became passionate about this concern and took a risk in developing her own consultant agency. She works extensively with schools, parents, and teachers.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:46] - Now, law enforcement takes cyber crime more seriously.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:51] - Susan says that although there is acknowledgement of cyberbullying and online safety issues, there is still a lack of training of front line police officers.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:50] - Susan describes JACKET teams in Australia and how it works in her country.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:30] - The amount of arrests is phenomenal, but Susan would much rather there were no arrests because we can educate young people to not fall victim to these types of crimes.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:27] - Susan shares that most arrests are made within Australia but that there are international crime gangs specifically in sex trafficking and sexual exploitation that are elsewhere.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:08] - The statistics in Australia show that a quarter of all teens have been cyber bullied at some point. This can mean a lot of different things. It's almost always an extension of schoolyard bullying.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:47] - Nude photos are also prominent and fit the definition of child exploitation offenses.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:58] - To be an effective parent in the 21st century, you have to parent in the digital space.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:43] - The internet is 100% an adult world that you are putting your child into. Risks cannot be removed but you can identify and limit the risk with boundaries for your child.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:18] - Young people’s technical skill far outweighs their cognitive and brain development. There is a massive gap between what they can actually do and what they can understand.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:29] - Susan explains that if your child is under 13, you should be in complete control over everything your child does online.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:33] - Start with one platform that you can manage when you feel they are ready for it. Constant monitoring and parent judgement on maturity is necessary.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:01] - Susan recommends having a rule in place that you will check all accounts and devices a certain number of random days per month.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:33] - Checking lists of friends and contacts, the child has to explain who they are to the parent’s expectations. If you can’t invite them over for dinner, they don’t belong on their list.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:55] - Susan shares how the majority of in-person sexual abuse or exploitation are with people the victim knows. But online, the majority are people who are unknown to the child or teen.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:02] - If you are familiar with the person and are unsure if it is their real account, ask them.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:27] - Parents also need to have conversations prior to online use to make sure their children are not being the ones doing the bullying.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:45] - If you are the caretaker of any child or minor, you have to be aware that they are targets.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:03] - Susan explains that the majority of inappropriate photos are taken in bedrooms and bathrooms with the doors closed. She shares examples of ways a parent can prohibit devices with cameras in those rooms.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:48] - Especially during Covid, the limitation of devices and children online became difficult.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:28] - One of the biggest mistakes parents make is giving their child or teen a phone thinking it will keep them safe. They are handy, but they are not safety devices.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[30:18] - Susan also lists the other issues that come with extensive use of electronic devices, including posture, muscular and skeletal problems, and eye strain.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:27] - Every adult has a responsibility to keep children safe on and offline. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:34] - Susan recommends several websites for parent and child education on cyber safety that include games and kid friendly language.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[37:59] - Susan is also the author of</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sexts, Texts, and Selfies</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">which is an internationally available book. The only changes based on the country are the laws and legislation.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[40:12] - It is everywhere no matter the crime. Cyber safety is absolutely crucial.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve got student loans, you feel the pressure of that financial obligation, but watch out. There are scammers looking to take advantage of your situation, offering student loan consolidation or elimination for a fee. Our guest today is Robert Farrington.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert is founder of</span> <a href="https://thecollegeinvestor.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">The College Investor</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">. He has been featured in many media outlets such as The New York Times, Washington Post, ABC and NBC News. As America’s millennial money expert and America’s student loan debt expert, he is on a mission to help people escape student loan debt and start building wealth for their future.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Show Notes:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:54] - Robert founded</span> <a href="https://thecollegeinvestor.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">The College Investor</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">website when he was a college student. He shares his background as a blogger and his experience when a post about student loan debt went viral.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:33] - College is a great investment for a lot of people, but like any investment, if you spend too much it might not be worth it.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:01] - You don’t go to college to learn because you find everything you need online for free. College is a signal to potential employers that you have a degree.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:02] - Robert points out that trade schools and “dirty jobs” are a fantastic opportunity to make a lot of money without going to college but that many young adults don’t know enough about them.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:29] - There are three main types of schools: state school, non-profit, and for-profit. Robert gives examples of each kind.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:39] - One type of student loan is federal student loans through the government with the requirement that you attend an accredited school.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:23] - The other type of student loan is a private student loan that comes from a bank, credit card company, or other private lender. These are similar to a mortgage.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:15] - Robert shares that there are so many student loan scams out there but they all have the same theme: to either lower the monthly payment or lower the total amount somehow.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:32] - There are many programs that are legitimate and that</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">will</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">lower your monthly payment. The red flag is the fee that you pay. Robert explains how this works.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:01] - The most popular loan forgiveness program that is fully legitimate is the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that there is no fee for.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:11] - There is loan consolidation which takes all your loans and puts them into one loan. Robert doesn’t recommend this and explains why.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:13] - If you call your lender and let them know that you can’t pay, there is something they can do. It is a scam if you pay a third party and they can fill out your paperwork incorrectly.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:26] - Robert describes another type of scammers that pose as a pseudo law firm that tells people to stop paying their loans and then go to court for them to represent you to get you lower payments. But this trashes your credit and doesn’t get you ahead.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:03] - Robert recommends to always start with caller your lender and talk to them about your options. Communicate your needs.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:51] - There are also really great apps available that will help you manage your finances and Robert points out that there are valid and legitimate paid programs.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:16] - The legitimate paid financial advisors won’t do anything</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">for</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">you. They will give you a plan and you will need to take the steps to follow the plan.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:39] - Robert admits that most loan service providers make errors and there are definitely problems. However, they manage loans for millions of people.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:51] - All paperwork done on your behalf needs to be looked over. A lot of companies that have been shut down were because of falsified information.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:38] - Robert explains how some scam companies will take your fees and not do any work at all. They’ll send you email updates as if things are being done and then you default.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:28] - Even if you are going to work with someone, you still need to log in to your loan provider account and check things every month. Ultimately, you are responsible.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:09] - Congress wants government loan servicers to promote these programs but they never do. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:01] - If you feel that you have been scammed, you need to lock down all of your information. Change all passwords and check all of your accounts to make sure your information has not been changed.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:20] - No legitimate company will ever ask you for your password or log in on your behalf. It is a literal federal crime.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:58] - Robert shares the most incredible dollar amounts that some scam companies have collected.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:51] - Robert also explains that some people pay companies to do this work for them because they don’t take the time to do the research.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[30:01] - Student loans are challenging because it seems like there’s no way out. People know that there’s not a lot of options. Scammers are preying on.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:36] - There are 100 Americans with over 100 million dollars in student loans. They got there because of graduate schools.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:00] - There are two types of people who benefit the most from student loans. The first are low-income who plan to make between $30-$50k a year. The other one are the ones who borrow over $100k per year for graduate school.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[35:34] - It always starts with getting organized. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, get it organized and look at it all.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, we deviate a bit from our traditional topics to incorporate the growing diversity in the Infosec world. In the past, this has been a male dominated field, but the culture is changing. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our guest today is Eleanor Dallway. Eleanor is the Editorial Director at Infosecurity Magazine, and she is at the front of the security industry. She has more than 15 years of online job experience and knows more about information security than most English Literature graduates should. She spends her working days interviewing industry professionals, keeping the website updated with news on a regular basis, editing the magazine, and attending industry events. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:03] - Eleanor’s experience in Infosec began in 2006 when she started working for Infosecurity Magazine. She also has experience editing for a wine and spirits magazine as well as one for retail.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:03] - Eleanor admits that information security is her favorite, because she’s worked in it the longest and it is constantly changing.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:51] - Her favorite part of her job is interviewing industry professionals. She shares several famous individuals who she has been able to interview.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:18] - Eleanor admits that she was very nervous to interview Kevin Mitnick and describes the experience.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:57] - Kevin Mitnick did magic tricks for Eleanor for fun, but demonstrated how con artists are very much like magicians.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:55] - Chris and Eleanor chat about their different interviews with previous podcast guest John McAfee.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:14] - John McAfee spoke an unscripted rant at an event that Eleanor was able to be present for.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:30] - Infosec trends are compared to fashion trends because they are cyclical and come back again.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:38] - Some trends that Eleanor discusses are the Cloud, artificial intelligence, and the focus on the human side of security.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:13] - Awareness now is much different than it was 15 years ago when Eleanor began working for Infosecurity Magazine. Now, they are major headlines and mainstream news.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:48] - Eleanor’s company puts in software that randomly tests people. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:31] - We start to distrust people who are actually trustworthy and tend to become cynical. </span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:18] - The types of scams that trend ebb and flow. Sometimes the trend is text scams, emails, or phone calls, generally speaking.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:40] - There are clever scammers who use the current climate to change their approach. Eleanor shares that she has seen a lot of scams with packages delivered because more people are shopping online.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:56] - When someone targets Eleanor, she knows she can handle it, but she gets very angry when scammers target her parents and grandmother.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:52] - Eleanor discusses various conferences and events. She doesn’t tend to worry about heavy security for some of them, but for several of them, she takes every precaution.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:10] - For the most part, Eleanor tends to go to more of the businessy conferences.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[30:42] - Eleanor admits that most of the things on her phone or computer are not that interesting so she feels comfortable taking her devices with her to other countries when traveling.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[31:28] - In regards to women in the industry, Eleanor says that it is still male dominated but it is moving in the right direction.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:48] - Eleanor has worked with programs that encourage teenage girls in high school to get into the infosec and technology world.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:25] - Eleanor launched Women in Cybersecurity Networking Group that began small in the UK but is now national.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we deviate a bit from our traditional topics to incorporate the growing diversity in the Infosec world. In the past, this has been a male dominated field, but the culture is changing. </p> <p>Our guest today is Eleanor Dallway. Eleanor is the Editorial Director at Infosecurity Magazine, and she is at the front of the security industry. She has more than 15 years of online job experience and knows more about information security than most English Literature graduates should. She spends her working days interviewing industry professionals, keeping the website updated with news on a regular basis, editing the magazine, and attending industry events. </p> Show Notes: <ul> <li>[1:03] - Eleanor’s experience in Infosec began in 2006 when she started working for Infosecurity Magazine. She also has experience editing for a wine and spirits magazine as well as one for retail.</li> <li>[2:03] - Eleanor admits that information security is her favorite, because she’s worked in it the longest and it is constantly changing.</li> <li>[2:51] - Her favorite part of her job is interviewing industry professionals. She shares several famous individuals who she has been able to interview.</li> <li>[4:18] - Eleanor admits that she was very nervous to interview Kevin Mitnick and describes the experience.</li> <li>[5:57] - Kevin Mitnick did magic tricks for Eleanor for fun, but demonstrated how con artists are very much like magicians.</li> <li>[9:55] - Chris and Eleanor chat about their different interviews with previous podcast guest John McAfee.</li> <li>[11:14] - John McAfee spoke an unscripted rant at an event that Eleanor was able to be present for.</li> <li>[12:30] - Infosec trends are compared to fashion trends because they are cyclical and come back again.</li> <li>[13:38] - Some trends that Eleanor discusses are the Cloud, artificial intelligence, and the focus on the human side of security.</li> <li>[15:13] - Awareness now is much different than it was 15 years ago when Eleanor began working for Infosecurity Magazine. Now, they are major headlines and mainstream news.</li> <li>[16:48] - Eleanor’s company puts in software that randomly tests people. </li> <li>[19:31] - We start to distrust people who are actually trustworthy and tend to become cynical. </li> <li>[20:18] - The types of scams that trend ebb and flow. Sometimes the trend is text scams, emails, or phone calls, generally speaking.</li> <li>[21:40] - There are clever scammers who use the current climate to change their approach. Eleanor shares that she has seen a lot of scams with packages delivered because more people are shopping online.</li> <li>[23:56] - When someone targets Eleanor, she knows she can handle it, but she gets very angry when scammers target her parents and grandmother.</li> <li>[25:52] - Eleanor discusses various conferences and events. She doesn’t tend to worry about heavy security for some of them, but for several of them, she takes every precaution.</li> <li>[28:10] - For the most part, Eleanor tends to go to more of the businessy conferences.</li> <li>[30:42] - Eleanor admits that most of the things on her phone or computer are not that interesting so she feels comfortable taking her devices with her to other countries when traveling.</li> <li>[31:28] - In regards to women in the industry, Eleanor says that it is still male dominated but it is moving in the right direction.</li> <li>[32:48] - Eleanor has worked with programs that encourage teenage girls in high school to get into the infosec and technology world.</li> <li>[33:25] - Eleanor launched Women in Cybersecurity Networking Group that began small in the UK but is now national. The purpose is to create a community.</li> <li>[35:02] - Marketing cybersecurity needs a lot of change to include more accurate images and descriptions.</li> <li>[36:11] - There’s a lot of going on in this space in regards to diversity in the industry, but Eleanor feels that it is not being done quickly enough.</li> <li>[37:33] - The security industry is very resilient and has not been hurt by the pandemic except that they are shorthanded. Unemployment is high in many places, so people should be jumping ship and going into it.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we start the new year, we often contemplate resolutions and adopting new behaviors into our lives. Good mentoring relationships can have an amazingly powerful impact on both our personal and professional lives, but a bad one can lead to a devastating outcome. Learn how to identify a great match in today’s episode with Mark Timm.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Timm has been a serial entrepreneur and exponential thinking practitioner for nearly two decades. He started more than two dozen companies, several of which have multiplied and been sold. His experience with dealing with the entrepreneurial challenges has fueled his passion for teaching people how to balance the demands of family life and business.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:15] - Mark co-wrote the book</span> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Mentor-Millions-Secrets-Business-Relationships-ebook/dp/B082ZQ84XL"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentor to Millions</span></em></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">because of his experiences (good and bad) with mentors. He describes how he met the friend he wrote the book with.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:32] - Where mentorship goes bad is when you think you have found the right person due to their success.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:28] - The first thing to look for in a mentor is to ask them about their failures. You want a mentor who is not only a big success story.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:17] - The second thing to look for in a mentor is their ability to really listen. A good mentor will listen and learn about you in order to help you down the right path.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:58] - The third thing to look for is a mentor who has a mentor themselves. Learning is a lifelong journey.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:31] - Mark shares a negative experience with a mentor in an industry he didn’t know much about. This mentor tended to tell Mark everything he was doing wrong.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:51] - Mark likes to have more than one mentor because one mentor is not capable of helping you in every facet of your life.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:45] - Most people don’t know how to find a mentor. It begins by having some vulnerability. Are you ready to be coached and taught?</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:59] - You already know everyone you need to know in order to accomplish everything that you need to accomplish in this world. Your inner circle may know the exact person you need.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:51] - The formula is 1) get the right mentor, 2) become that mentor’s best student, and 3) take everything you’ve learned and teach it to someone else.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:05] - Mark ends every chapter in</span> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Mentor-Millions-Secrets-Business-Relationships-ebook/dp/B082ZQ84XL"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentor to Millions</span></em></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with him applying what he learned in his business to his family.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:06] - Mark describes how important his mentorship experiences have been with his family.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:23] - Mark gives an example of how a personality test that he was using in his business and how he bought extras to do with his family in the same way.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:58] - The personality test experience gave Mark’s family a tool to be themselves and understand each other.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:26] - In regards to finding a mentor that is “wired differently” than yourself, there are so many different situations and combinations of people.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:55] - When you can say that you know the person, you like the person, and you trust the person, there could be a very good opportunity for a mentorship when you know they can help you.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:36] - Anyone can learn, but it takes the right kind of person to teach.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:11] - If you’d like to become a mentor, you need to practice listening and be open about your failures and how you’ve learned from them.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:17] - Mark talks about</span> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Mentor-Millions-Secrets-Business-Relationships-ebook/dp/B082ZQ84XL"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentor to Millions</span></em></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and his experiences with a great mentor.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:00] - Mark is one his way to his first multi-million dollar business because of the lessons he’s learned with his mentor.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:38] - Now, Mark mentors successful entrepreneurs with their family and home life, which is what Mark is passionate about.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:03] - It is not all about balance, it's about integration. Mark describes how combining his worlds made a huge difference in his business and relationships.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">[30:29] - Mark and Kevin and offering a special mentoring opportunity to listeners who buy the book.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our body can give clues to what we are thinking or feeling and review of what we’re saying is the truth or deception. How can we use that fact to detect when</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">others</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">are being deceptive?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Traci Brown. Time magazine has named Traci as one of the nation’s top deception detection experts. She’s trained alongside the country’s top law enforcement, and she is a frequent television guest and the author of</span> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Detect-Lies-Fraud-Identity-Theft-ebook/dp/B06X9668WZ"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Detect Lies, Fraud, and Identity Theft Field Guide</span></em></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of us have received that call from someone claiming to be from Microsoft Tech Support saying that there is an issue with our computer that they want to help us resolve. This scam has evolved into something so sophisticated and so refined that it has become big business in and of itself.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Jim Browning. Jim can’t stand scammers, so he’s doing something about it. Jim has been baiting, investigating, and exposing scammers on his YouTube channel for over 5 years. His channel now has over 2.3 million subscribers and many of his videos showing how these scams work have been watched millions of times. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[0:51] - Most people recognize tech support scams as a cold call where the scammer claims they are working for a company that needs you to get on your computer to gain access.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:34] - Jim says the way to put these people off is to deny having the device they are asking for you to connect.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:13] - These types of scammers might also claim they are your bank or credit card company. Either way, this scam is all about logging into your account and giving them access.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:32] - Jim describes what would happen if a scammer gains access to your computer after you follow the steps they give you over the phone.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:01] - Jim never intended to be a YouTuber. In fact, he has a “proper” job in IT and is an engineer at heart. But as someone who received these calls, he became curious and one day recorded what a scammer did.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:23] - More often than not, the people running these scams are out of a different country and it is near impossible to do anything about it through law enforcement.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[8:21] - Jim shares that India’s equivalent to the FBI has recently conducted raids and some of these operations may actually be dealt with.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:27] - Through running scams, Jim describes how one operation brought in over a million dollars per month and employed several hundred people.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:19] - When hiring, these operations may hire people who don’t know they’re scammers. Some, though, actually advertise that they are scammers.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:27] - With enough computer knowledge and the curiosity, Jim let scammers access his computer but was able to reverse it and gain access to their computer instead.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:31] - Jim tells a story about how he accessed a scammer’s CCTV recording and was able to see and hear how they are running their operation.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:12] - These scammers take the business very seriously and professionally. Like legitimate organizations, they record calls and use them to train their employees.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:39] - Sometimes scammers will retain the access to the computer, but most of the time, they will get their one-off payment and it will likely be the last time you hear from them or you won’t hear from them for a while.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:56] - If you are scammed once, your information will be sold to other scammers. Once you’ve been victimized, you are far more likely to fall victim again.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:10] - The cold calls are the most common, but a more subtle scam is to Google for genuine support. Some sites are not genuine and many people do not check the legitimacy of the site.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:27] - There are various software you can install on your computer that help identify a site that is not legitimate.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:14] - If you think you are a victim of a scam, you need to start by contacting your bank or credit card company as quickly as possible. If it has been several months, it is very hard to get your money back.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:40] - The most safe thing to do if you fall victim of a scam is to completely wipe your computer and start over. But Jim does state that most of the time, scammers are only in it for a one-off payment so you might not need to do that.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:01] - Jim has also seen scammers take identities to open up bank accounts in order to launder money.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:46] - There are scams that ask for gift cards, which is as good as cash in most cases. If you use a gift card or read out a gift card number, you will not get your money back.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:40] - No legitimate online business is going to ask for gift cards and is a big red flag. The big one right now are Amazon gift cards.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:52] - A lot of employees who sell gift cards are trained to ask the customer who is buying large denominations on a gift card to ask if they have been put up to it. But Jim gives examples about how scammers get around this.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:55] - Scamming organizations have also recruited people in the US and the UK to be a part of these scams to make it more believable because of their lack of foreign accent.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[31:42] - Scammers have been known to cunningly coach people into willingly transferring money to them.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:40] - No legitimate company will ever have a problem with you asking questions. Be a skeptic.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[33:44] - Another red flag for a scam is urgency to take action. Always stop and ask questions and call them on the number you know is accurate.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[34:28] - Anyone can forge a number. You cannot trust the caller ID. But there is something possibly happening in the United States that will help identify real numbers.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[36:49] - Jim’s YouTube channel shows how scams work and can help you recognize when a call could be a scam. His YouTube channel’s mission is to bring awareness.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

The big one right now are Amazon gift cards.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[27:52] - A lot of employees who sell gift cards are trained to ask the customer who is buying large denominations on a gift card to ask if they have been put up to it. But Jim gives examples about how scammers get around this.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[29:55] - Scamming organizations have also recruited people in the US and the UK to be a part of these scams to make it more believable because of their lack of foreign accent.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[31:42] - Scammers have been known to cunningly coach people into willingly transferring money to them.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[32:40] - No legitimate company will ever have a problem with you asking questions. Be a skeptic.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[33:44] - Another red flag for a scam is urgency to take action. Always stop and ask questions and call them on the number you know is accurate.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[34:28] - Anyone can forge a number. You cannot trust the caller ID. But there is something possibly happening in the United States that will help identify real numbers.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[36:49] - Jim’s YouTube channel shows how scams work and can help you recognize when a call could be a scam. His YouTube channel’s mission is to bring awareness.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there such a thing as an ethical hacker? Do all hackers use their skills to attack infrastructures? If you’re interested in ethical hacking and penetration testing, this is the episode for you. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Ed Skoudis. Ed has taught upwards of 20,000 security professionals globally and his contributions to information security have had an immense impact on the community. His courses distill the essence of real world frontline case studies he accumulates, because he is consistently one of the first authorities brought in to provide post-attack analysis on major breeches. He’s not just an expert in the field, he’s created many of the founding methodologies empowered by governments and organizations around the world to test and secure their infrastructures.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ed is the founder of the SANS Penetration Testing Curriculum and Counter Hack; leads the team that builds NetWars, Holiday Hack, and CyberCity; and serves on the Board of Directors for the SANS Technology Institute. A consummate presenter, Ed is a keynote speaker appearing internationally at conferences, and is an Advisory Board member for RSA.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:14] - Ed introduces himself as a penetration tester and hacker. He does expert witness work on large scale breeches and incident response.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:37] - He started this path as hacking for phone companies. He explains how he started and why he was hired.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:55] - Ed describes what penetration testing (or pen testing) is. It is when he models the techniques used by real world attackers and then apply them in structured fashion to help protect companies from future attacks.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:53] - Pen tests can be used by an organization for a specific reason or can be done as a “check-up” to make sure everything is okay.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:40] - Zero Day is researching vulnerabilities that aren’t known yet. It is called Zero Day because it has been known for zero days.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:18] - Ed never believed the cybersecurity industry would be as huge as it is today and explains some of the more recent issues we’ve been seeing through Covid.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:52] - Security is now a part of the process and is becoming less of an afterthought. Ed shares this idea long-term, but sees the same vulnerabilities repeatedly.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[8:49] - There is no such thing as 100% safe and secure. The goal is to raise the bar to make things more difficult for an attacker.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:31] - With ransomware, attackers have figured out a really reliable way to get paid for their malware.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:08] - Ransomware is a real problem and have even attacked hospitals and local governments.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:37] - There is so much that we do that leaves us vulnerable.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:29] - One major piece of advice that Ed gives in regards to general consumer security is to keep all of your devices patched and updated.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:18] - Another area to be aware of is always spear phishing. Don’t click unless you are confident in the link.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:19] - Ed has a separate computer that is separate and independent that he</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">only</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">uses for financial transactions. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:17] - Chris and Ed discuss routers that consumers buy from their ISP.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:01] - Ed shares how “Live Off the Land” attacks work by using what is already installed on a computer. These are harder to detect.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:18] - With ransomware, organizations have to think about what is best for the business. Is it better to give the attacker the money or spend the time and money to fix the problem?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:27] - The dominant trend in technology today is cloud storage.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:18] - Ed describes how this works and some of the various problems associated with it.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:39] - The US Army, Tesla, and Uber are a few organizations that have lost data to this common vulnerability.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:10] - Ed describes the Holiday Hack Challenge and the fun way he has modeled this problem to educate users.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:03] - Although there are some security risks if not managed properly, Ed shares that cloud data storage is a very cost effective option for small to medium sized businesses.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:24] - Most organizations use multiple cloud services. Cloud migration is good if a different service is necessary, but the previous cloud service is left alone and vulnerable.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[31:01] - The Holiday Hack Challenge is a free educational event that Ed and his team have created to solve cybersecurity challenges. This is a worldwide event.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[34:02] - The Holiday Hack Challenge is something that some people participate in with their kids due to the video game aspect. There is also a social aspect to it with the chat feature.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[35:29] - Not only is the Holiday Hack Challenge free, but all of the past challenges are free and accessible to play. This can build your skills.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[36:30] - Chris asks if Holiday Hack Challenge has ever been compromised. Ed admits that there are three people who have hacked their way in as players, but there were no purposeful attacks.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[39:43] - Ed admits that he sees the world through the eyes of an ethical hacker because he likes to explore and see what’s beyond the edges. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[40:48] - Chris and Ed discuss Bug Bounty Programs and can be useful.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Giving Tuesday right around the corner, it is important to make sure that the money we give gets to the causes we are passionate about. In the midst of the season of giving, scammers are working to get as much of your charity as they can.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guests are Michael Thatcher and Zachary Weinsteiger. Michael leads</span> <a href= "https://www.charitynavigator.org/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Charity Navigator</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">and its efforts to make impactful philanthropy easier for all by increasing the breadth and depth of ratings coverage of a large number of charities. He has held various board positions within the non-profit and tech sector, holds several patents in enterprise systems management, and has a degree from Columbia University in New York. Zachary is on Charity Navigator’s analyst team and is responsible for data collection, research analysis, and the evaluation of the performance of America’s largest charities. He also works towards improving the evaluation system and process.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:16] - Michael has been with Charity Navigator for about 5 years, but previously worked for Microsoft. He was attracted to Charity Navigator to make a more positive impact.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:04] - Zachary initially intended on being an educator on the college level, but during the course of study he felt that he wanted to do more. He wound up with Charity Navigator after hearing someone speak at his graduation.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:53] - Charity Navigator was started in the early 2000’s by someone who was wealthy and wanted to donate money. He noticed that there was no way to evaluate the organizations he would invest in, so he started it himself.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:42] - Michael shares how large the non-profit and charity sector is in the United States.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:10] - On one hand, there are several successfully run charities, but then there are some that fall apart.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:42] - Michael started working in the non-profit sector when he opened a dance company with his wife. Unfortunately, it failed, but now he has found himself in a similar position running Charity Navigator.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[8:03] - The hardest part about charity scams is that they’re scams and until they get caught, we don’t know they’re scams.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:32] - Zachary says that sometimes the donors might not actually know they were scammed and move forward without knowing.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:43] - If you feel like you have been scammed, you need to report it, regardless of the feeling of embarrassment that many people feel.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:04] - Look for transparency. Legitimate charities will have a website and will be able to direct you over the phone to a way to find out more about them.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:10] - Be intentional with your giving. Donate to causes that you care about and find out if the charity in question is on Charity Navigator.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:29] - During times of crisis, people change their giving philosophy. This year, the United States has seen different crises and people may be donating to charities they don’t normally notice.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:21] - Charity Navigator has a relationship with GoFundMe and Michael says it is a legitimate, strong, and successfully run crowd-funding site. But if you don’t know the person and have a real relationship with that person, you need to be wary.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:04] - What Zachary notices with GoFundMe is when individuals donate to others they don’t know, there’s no form of accountability.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:09] - There are organizations that are a good filter to avoid fabricated stories on GoFundMe. Michael shares them as</span> <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Give Directly</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">and</span> <a href= "https://www.donorschoose.org/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Donors Choose</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:39] - When you donate to charities through Give Directly and Donors Choose instead of GoFundMe, you can use them as a tax write off. When you donate to an individual on GoFundMe, you cannot.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:08] - One of the key things that Charity Navigator looks for is strong financial performance. Michael describes what this looks like and why it is important.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:41] - Another important facet that Charity Navigator looks for to establish their ratings is the charity’s level of transparency and governance.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:33] - Overhead costs are not a bad thing. The salaries of the people that work with the charity organizations are important too. Charity Navigator looks at this as well.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:02] - Michael dives into the way their rating system works and what a rating could mean.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:19] - There really isn’t a one-size-fits-all that works in this space. Michael compares a charity that supports an orchestra versus an organization for a homeless shelter. Charity Navigator does not cross compare.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:36] - Charity Navigator is the largest independent evaluator of charities in the US and has been around for 20 years.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[31:14] - Charity Navigator has a team of only 26 people to maintain a small business feel and keep their costs low as well. Each analyst is assigned a specific type of charity that they themselves care about. Zachary explains how this works.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[33:25] - Another thing Charity Navigator sees frequently is when costs disappear. Zachary explains how this works and how it goes into an evaluation.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[35:53] - Charity Navigator uses the form charities fill out to establish and maintain the organization. This creates uniformity, consistency, and gives them a way to determine if a charity is being truthful.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[39:42] - Michael explains how and why the end of the year sees an increase in donations and traffic to their site.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[41:18] - Scams pop up during this time of year as well because scammers know that people are in a rush and are in an emotionally driven time to give.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[43:13] - Charity Navigator has a feature called The Giving Basket which allows you to donate to an organization through their website. This is a very safe way to make a donation to make sure it goes directly to the right place.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[44:55] - Before you give, do your research. Slow down and look at everything you can find about the organization.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[45:39] - Think of your giving as an investment and follow the money. Stay connected to the non-profits you give to because you are investing in the changes they bring to the world.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Giving Tuesday right around the corner, it is important to make sure that the money we give gets to the causes we are passionate about. In the midst of the season of giving, scammers are working to get as much of your charity as they can.</p> <p>Today’s guests are Michael Thatcher and Zachary Weinsteiger. Michael leads <a href= "https://www.charitynavigator.org/">Charity Navigator</a> and its efforts to make impactful philanthropy easier for all by increasing the breadth and depth of ratings coverage of a large number of charities. He has held various board positions within the non-profit and tech sector, holds several patents in enterprise systems management, and has a degree from Columbia University in New York. Zachary is on Charity Navigator’s analyst team and is responsible for data collection, research analysis, and the evaluation of the performance of America’s largest charities. He also works towards improving the evaluation system and process.</p> Show Notes: <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[1:16] - Michael has been with Charity Navigator for about 5 years, but previously worked for Microsoft. He was attracted to Charity Navigator to make a more positive impact.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[2:04] - Zachary initially intended on being an educator on the college level, but during the course of study he felt that he wanted to do more. He wound up with Charity Navigator after hearing someone speak at his graduation.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[2:53] - Charity Navigator was started in the early 2000’s by someone who was wealthy and wanted to donate money. He noticed that there was no way to evaluate the organizations he would invest in, so he started it himself.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[4:42] - Michael shares how large the non-profit and charity sector is in the United States.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[6:10] - On one hand, there are several successfully run charities, but then there are some that fall apart.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[6:42] - Michael started working in the non-profit sector when he opened a dance company with his wife. Unfortunately, it failed, but now he has found himself in a similar position running Charity Navigator.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[8:03] - The hardest part about charity scams is that they’re scams and until they get caught, we don’t know they’re scams.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[9:32] - Zachary says that sometimes the donors might not actually know they were scammed and move forward without knowing.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[10:43] - If you feel like you have been scammed, you need to report it, regardless of the feeling of embarrassment that many people feel.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[11:04] - Look for transparency. Legitimate charities will have a website and will be able to direct you over the phone to a way to find out more about them.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[13:10] - Be intentional with your giving. Donate to causes that you care about and find out if the charity in question is on Charity Navigator.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[14:29] - During times of crisis, people change their giving philosophy. This year, the United States has seen different crises and people may be donating to charities they don’t normally notice.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[16:21] - Charity Navigator has a relationship with GoFundMe and Michael says it is a legitimate, strong, and successfully run crowd-funding site. But if you don’t know the person and have a real relationship with that person, you need to be wary.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[18:04] - What Zachary notices with GoFundMe is when individuals donate to others they don’t know, there’s no form of accountability.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[20:09] - There are organizations that are a good filter to avoid fabricated stories on GoFundMe. Michael shares them as <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/">Give Directly</a> and <a href= "https://www.donorschoose.org/">Donors Choose</a>.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[21:39] - When you donate to charities through Give Directly and Donors Choose instead of GoFundMe, you can use them as a tax write off.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As cybercrime grows more sophisticated day by day, so do technical defenses. But great technology is no match for an employee clicking on a simple phishing email. Psychological security is designed to protect the human mind from manipulation that leads to compromises.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s guest is Adam Anderson. Adam is chairman of the board for Hook Security and a serial cybersecurity entrepreneur. He is one of the founders of the Psychological Security Movement. Psychological Security or “Psy-Sec,” was born to create new technologies and processes to help build resilient human minds that can resist manipulations through technology.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Show Notes:</span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:10] - Adam introduces himself as a serial cybersecurity entrepreneur who has launched 21 companies over 20 years. He is passionate about this topic.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:24] - The human part of cybersecurity is always the weakest link.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:01] - Chris and Adam discuss how when you work in IT, you look at things through an IT lens, but there is a human side.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:21] - Security is typically an afterthought that comes after an incident.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:51] - Adam breaks down the meaning of security and what types you will see within a company or corporation as being physical security and info security.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:42] - Adam says that both types of security are vulnerable to social engineering.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:31] - Hook Security was created after Adam worked in frustration for 20 years. He is chairman of the board and hired a successful educator as CEO who is an expert in how people learn.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:23] - Adam is a firm believer that “Psy-Sec” needs to be a separate department of professionals who can work to build resilience in human brains to resist manipulation.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:15] - It is unreasonable to expect the IT department to be proficient in the human interface as it is not in their skillset.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:42] - Adam states that systems are 95% safe from compromise which is a great improvement, but when you have a large company, 5% is still too much.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:12] - Right now, Adam is working with the cognitive brain function and explains the details on how this works in regards to psychological security.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:10] - There are two ways to lay down memories and “fight or flight.” One is through fear and one is through humor.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:27] - People are better at remembering something that made them laugh and Adam trains people with this in mind.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:26] - Hook Security provides Security Awareness Training that people actually enjoy.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:06] - Hook Security is being very careful with how they present their findings and taking their time with the science elements involved so that it is used for good and not as a tool for attackers.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:54] - Social engineering is no different from simple marketing. Marketing is there to show you something that you may find valuable and hope that you click on it. Social engineering is the same, but “with a different punch line.”</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:56] - There’s a database. You’re in it. You are a product. If you are getting something for free or are paying something low, you are the product. Adam uses a Netflix example to demonstrate this.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:52] - With the way YouTube and Netflix work, you are trusting big corporations to have your best interests at heart.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:52] - We are all wired to help others. These hard-wired responses allow marketers and attackers to take advantage.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:16] - Chris and Adam discuss that the way marketing works is not a bad thing because they want to see the recommendations based on their interests. But they can be used negatively.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:39] - Fake news and “echo chambers” that we find ourselves in are designed to polarize people to different extremes.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:02] - Just like marketers who know who they are targeting to sell to, cybercriminals know what your triggers are to manipulate you into a compromising situation.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[31:46] - There are different types of triggers that cause us to fall for scams.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:08] - These triggers are wonderful when they happen organically and to help others but are terrifying when they are used against us.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[33:53] - Learning how to pause and evaluating whether something is true or not is crucial. If you can’t do that, Adam says to “reprogram your auto-pilot.”</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[36:14] - Your perception of the phone is that it is something that you get a lot of value from but it is also a place where people will call you and text you with fraudulent stuff. Some people can pause and question it and some cannot.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[38:12] - We all have blind spots and we don’t know what they are, so always have a support system to get others’ opinions on the matter before making certain choices.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[39:50] - It is imperative that we treat this seriously. We are throwing a burden on our “nerds” by having them try to understand the nuances of the human brain.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[41:39] - None of this science is new. We just need to apply it.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

Psychological Security or “Psy-Sec,” was born to create new technologies and processes to help build resilient human minds that can resist manipulations through technology.</p> <p>Show Notes:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[1:10] - Adam introduces himself as a serial cybersecurity entrepreneur who has launched 21 companies over 20 years. He is passionate about this topic.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[2:24] - The human part of cybersecurity is always the weakest link.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[4:01] - Chris and Adam discuss how when you work in IT, you look at things through an IT lens, but there is a human side.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[5:21] - Security is typically an afterthought that comes after an incident.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[5:51] - Adam breaks down the meaning of security and what types you will see within a company or corporation as being physical security and info security.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[6:42] - Adam says that both types of security are vulnerable to social engineering.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[7:31] - Hook Security was created after Adam worked in frustration for 20 years. He is chairman of the board and hired a successful educator as CEO who is an expert in how people learn.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[9:23] - Adam is a firm believer that “Psy-Sec” needs to be a separate department of professionals who can work to build resilience in human brains to resist manipulation.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[11:15] - It is unreasonable to expect the IT department to be proficient in the human interface as it is not in their skillset.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[12:42] - Adam states that systems are 95% safe from compromise which is a great improvement, but when you have a large company, 5% is still too much.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[13:12] - Right now, Adam is working with the cognitive brain function and explains the details on how this works in regards to psychological security.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[15:10] - There are two ways to lay down memories and “fight or flight.” One is through fear and one is through humor.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[16:27] - People are better at remembering something that made them laugh and Adam trains people with this in mind.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[18:26] - Hook Security provides Security Awareness Training that people actually enjoy.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[19:06] - Hook Security is being very careful with how they present their findings and taking their time with the science elements involved so that it is used for good and not as a tool for attackers.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[21:54] - Social engineering is no different from simple marketing. Marketing is there to show you something that you may find valuable and hope that you click on it. Social engineering is the same, but “with a different punch line.”</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[22:56] - There’s a database. You’re in it. You are a product. If you are getting something for free or are paying something low, you are the product. Adam uses a Netflix example to demonstrate this.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[24:52] - With the way YouTube and Netflix work, you are trusting big corporations to have your best interests at heart.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[25:52] - We are all wired to help others. These hard-wired responses allow marketers and attackers to take advantage.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[27:16] - Chris and Adam discuss that the way marketing works is not a bad thing because they want to see the recommendations based on their interests. But they can be used negatively.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[28:39] - Fake news and “echo chambers” that we find ourselves in are designed to polarize people to different extremes.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[30:02] - Just like marketers who know who they are targeting to sell to, cybercriminals know what your triggers are to manipulate you into a compromising situation.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[31:46] - There are different types of triggers that cause us to fall for scams.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[32:08] - These triggers are wonderful when they happen organically and to help others but are terrifying when they are used against us.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[33:53] - Learning how to pause and evaluating whether something is true or not is crucial. If you can’t do that, Adam says to “reprogram your auto-pilot.”</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[36:14] - Your perception of the phone is that it is something that you get a lot of value from but it is also a place where people will call you and text you with fraudulent stuff. Some people can pause and question it and some cannot.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[38:12] - We all have blind spots and we don’t know what they are, so always have a support system to get others’ opinions on the matter before making certain choices.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[39:50] - It is imperative that we treat this seriously. We are throwing a burden on our “nerds” by having them try to understand the nuances of the human brain.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[41:39] - None of this science is new. We just need to apply it.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

Through all of his crimes, his second marriage caused his sister to disown him.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:06] - It took several years of not speaking to his sister and justifying his actions for Brett to realize that he was in prison because he</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">chose</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">to break the law.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:08] - For three after being released from prison on probation in 2011, he couldn’t get a job because he wasn’t allowed to use a computer.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:13] - Brett met his current wife during this time and moved in with her.

He also works with AARP and other types of organizations.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:19] - A big misconception people have about cybercriminals is that they are very educated and can hack into anything.

Brett says to always use a password manager.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:38] - The reason a scam works is because the scammer and the victim are on opposite sides of the field.

Brett answers that it depends on whether or not the scammer is a sociopath. He says that most scammers are not and come to believe their own justifications.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[44:18] - There’s no beneficial thing about being a criminal.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[44:50] - Be proactive, not reactive, when it comes to security.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embezzlement is on the rise, but only a  few incidents ever get reported to law enforcement. Why do people steal and how are they doing it? What can business owners do to help prevent these crimes and what should they do if they suspect them?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our guest today is Kelly Paxton. She has more than 25 years of investigation experience and is a certified fraud examiner and private investigator. She started her career in law enforcement as a special agent for the US Customs Office of Investigation in 1993. She has worked white-collar crime, fraud, money laundering, embezzlement, and conflict of interest cases. Kelly is also the proud owner of Pink Collar Crime, a passion of hers about embezzlers in the workplace.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:02] - Kelly has always been interested in money. She started her career in finance but had a client arrested for fraud. She then became interested in investigating why people steal money.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:57] - Kelly’s goal is never to put someone in jail. Her goal is to find out why the person stole the money and to hopefully see the money returned to the victim.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:32] - Why do people steal money? Generally speaking, Kelly says most people will steal because they think that money will help them fix their problems.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:51] - Most people are good people, but life happens, and most people think money fixes it.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:11] - Embezzlement is stealing money from business. Kelly defines Pink Collar Crime as petty amounts stolen by low to mid-level employees, primarily women, from the workplace. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:40] - In the 80s, this was a shift in thinking. Up until then, most people hadn’t thought about embezzlement as a common crime.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:17] - Kelly explains that in embezzlement cases, there is a lot of victim shaming. Due to this, only 15% of embezzlement cases are reported to law enforcement.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[8:01] - Most victims</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">like</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">the employee and that is how the employee is able to steal. Trust is not an internal control.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[8:46] - 60%, or 3 out 5, of all dentists have been ripped off.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:13] - Kelly calls embezzlement “the crime of main street.”</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:01] - Financial audits are not always when losses are noticed. Tips and hotlines are actually more effective in finding out about these problems.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:06] - 90% of bookkeepers in the United States are women. Women push back against the title “Pink Collar Crime,” but should be pushing back that women are in lower-level positions as a whole.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:30] - Kelly shares an example of a woman who stole millions of dollars over 20 years. When she was arrested, she was exhausted because she could never take a vacation as she was afraid of being caught.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:48] - Another warning sign is a control freak, especially when it comes to changing computer programs.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:53] - The number one way people embezzle from the workplace is forged or unauthorized checks.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:28] - It is never good to be ripped off, but there are good things that come from it, including connections with other people and lessons learned on how to manage the business moving forward.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:36] - The principle doesn’t pay the principal, meaning the principle of being ripped off doesn’t pay the loss.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:16] - At the end of the day, you have to get back to work. The money is replaceable. The trust is difficult to get over.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:00] - Intuitively, you trust a coworker more than you trust a stranger. So you won’t always see this coming.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:41] - Trust but verify. Kelly uses an example of trusting your dentist when you have a cavity.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:47] - If you are a small business owner, Kelly recommends that you mail your bank statements mailed to your home or to a P.O. Box that only you can control.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:27] - Always look at the images of the checks on your online bank statements.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:49] - Mix up when you check things. Check different size checks, audit your own finances at different times of the year. Keep everyone guessing so they don’t see a pattern that they can take advantage of.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:10] - Kelly also suggests that you have a binder or system of some sort that outlines everything in the event that you need to show details in a case.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:23] - Business owners don’t generally look at all the checks going in and out of the business. Some business owners even have pre-signed blank checks to make tasks easier, but puts them at risk of fraud.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:01] - Kelly would rather train business owners to help prevent these events than to sit across from someone she is investigating as a criminal.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:48] - Kelly shares an example of one of the craziest cases she worked.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[34:18] - If someone starts at a business and if they steal within the first 6 months of working there, they’ve done it before. They may not have a criminal history or have not been caught yet.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[35:45] - If you walk into your house and you see a dead body, you call the police and you don’t touch anything. Unfortunately, with embezzlement, when a business owner notices something wrong, they go in and try to figure things out themselves and oftentimes mess up the crime scene.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[37:46] - Kelly is writing a book, but admits that it will be an ebook because most people won’t go into a bookstore to buy a book about embezzlement. This can be seen as embarrassing.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[39:07] - If you have proof of embezzlement, most of the time the employee will confess when confronted. But you need to be prepared and never confront them alone. Kelly recommends having a lawyer with you as a reliable witness.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[42:16] - The more people who have access to the information, the less likely the crime will happen.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[43:13] - There is no CSI Embezzlement. These cases take an extremely long time.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[44:40] - Law enforcement has limited resources and will need to put their focus on different types of cases due to the length of time and investigation needed to work on these cases. As a business owner, you will need to spend a lot of money to have things investigated.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[46:10] - There is also a level of embarrassment when things like this happen. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[48:42] - There’s not a national database of arrests and convictions. </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the cost of surveillance and mass information gathering becoming cheaper and easier, laws are struggling to keep pace. Who is fighting for transparency and working to protect</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">your</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">digital rights?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our guest today is Danny O’Brien. Danny has been an activist for online free speech and privacy for over 20 years. He co-founded the Open Rights Group and has defended reporters from online attacks at the committee to protect journalists. He is now the Director of Strategy at Electronic Frontier Foundation.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[0:59] - Danny began working with Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) in 2005 but had been interested in them and digital rights overall since 1990 as a journalist.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:18] - In the early days of EFF, the topics they were writing about seemed very theoretical to the everyday person. It became confusing, but a lot of these hypothetical situations were becoming reality in the early 2000s.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:06] - The assistance Danny gave to journalists to keep them safer from online attacks began on a case by case basis.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:23] - Danny explains that now they are seeing a rise in targeted attacks on journalists with government connections.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:50] - The tools to conduct a spyware style monitoring of a particular person are now so ridiculously cheap. It can be anyone. In the early days, it always seemed like an attack was government based or done by professionals.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[8:42] - Journalists in particular are highly targeted for attacks because they have likely upset someone they’ve reported about.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:49] - When Gmail was hacked in 2009, it became apparent that the people that were targeted in that attack were Tibetan activists.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:42] - There has been a shift into a professionalization of attacks.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the cost of surveillance and mass information gathering becoming cheaper and easier, laws are struggling to keep pace. Who is fighting for transparency and working to protect <em>your</em> digital rights?</p> <p>Our guest today is Danny O’Brien. Danny has been an activist for online free speech and privacy for over 20 years. He co-founded the Open Rights Group and has defended reporters from online attacks at the committee to protect journalists. He is now the Director of Strategy at Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p> Show Notes: <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[0:59] - Danny began working with Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) in 2005 but had been interested in them and digital rights overall since 1990 as a journalist.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[2:18] - In the early days of EFF, the topics they were writing about seemed very theoretical to the everyday person. It became confusing, but a lot of these hypothetical situations were becoming reality in the early 2000s.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[4:06] - The assistance Danny gave to journalists to keep them safer from online attacks began on a case by case basis.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[6:23] - Danny explains that now they are seeing a rise in targeted attacks on journalists with government connections.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[7:50] - The tools to conduct a spyware style monitoring of a particular person are now so ridiculously cheap. It can be anyone. In the early days, it always seemed like an attack was government based or done by professionals.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[8:42] - Journalists in particular are highly targeted for attacks because they have likely upset someone they’ve reported about.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[10:49] - When Gmail was hacked in 2009, it became apparent that the people that were targeted in that attack were Tibetan activists.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[11:42] - There has been a shift into a professionalization of attacks. It is someone’s job to clock on, hack and make someone’s life unpleasant, and clock off.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[13:10] - One of the key cases in the last several years in regards to digital privacy rights is the Apple San Bernardino case in which the FBI wanted a back door into the iPhone of a suspect in a shooting.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[14:36] - There is a gray area where governments are saying that as long as they have the ability to do these things, they should. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[17:16] - The globalization of technology has caused confusion and blurred lines on what is legal and illegal in each country.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[20:25] - Danny gives an example of a loophole in United States law regarding getting geolocation data from phones.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[23:13] - The process of getting information is very murky especially in the United States.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[24:41] - We need transparency before we will ever see reform.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[26:40] - Google would do something called The Creepy Test where they would demonstrate something they could do internally and determine whether it was something that could be used in a “creepy” way.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[28:29] - Something may seem like a great idea but wind up causing more bad than good. Danny uses apps for tracking the pandemic as an example.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[30:20] - As technologists, we are capable of acting very quickly and reaching for a toolkit that we can use.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[31:19] - Sometimes we have to be careful that the solutions that are the simplest from a technological point of view aren’t just shifting the complexity elsewhere. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[34:02] - The consequences of simply uploading photos online in regards to privacy were very unexpected at the start of the internet and social media.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[35:49] - In the 90s there was a strong fight against encryption. Now that encryption is what holds entire economies together.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[36:08] - While encryption is useful, it is also being used by cybercriminals to hide illegal activity, particularly child pornography.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[39:00] - We used to argue about digital rights but now all rights are digital. Now, all laws are about the internet.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[41:53] - Danny and Chris discuss the passage of a bill about the digital rights of sex workers that had several unintended consequences.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[43:12] - There is a big push right now to undermine encryption particularly for fighting against sex trafficking.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[44:04] - There are a lot of problems that have been created that were unintentionally created by technology that needs to be solved.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[45:06] - Large companies, like Apple, Google, and Amazon, have a lot of control of our personal devices.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[46:46] - We will start to see a lot of technological compromises between large companies and the government.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[48:44] - Pick the privacy tools and try out different tools to find what works for you.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information security is not just technical. There is a human aspect involved and fixing that is more than just identification and awareness. Our guest today is Ira Winkler. Ira is the president of Secure Mentem and the author of the book</span> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/You-CAN-Stop-Stupid-Accidental/dp/1119621984/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=ira+winkler&qid=1602558223&sr=8-4"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You Can Stop Stupid</span></em></a><em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">He is referred to as the modern-day James Bond, given his skills both physically and technically in infiltrating organizations. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Ira shares with us many of his personal and professional experiences in the area of cybercrime. His valuable tips and information can change how you look at potential threats and scams. He is an expert in how to make people easy prey and how to prevent people from being easy prey. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[0:51] - Ira graduated college as a psychology major and the only job he could get at that time was in the National Security Agency. This led him into the computer field within the military.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:31] - He always wound up working on the human side of things.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:03] - Ira shares his background and how he became a world-renowned penetration expert, which is a fancy name for a hacker.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:21] - The way you break something is not the way you fix it. This is an important concept when looking at psychology.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:01] - Psychology helps Ira exploit others but it is also important to understand when helping them.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:55] - Telling someone the problem and then telling them not to fall for a scam doesn’t work.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[8:50] - Ira and Chris discuss the recent Twitter hacks. Ira says that in this situation, anyone could have done what the hacker did because it was easy. You just have to have the questionable ethics and morals to do it.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:41] - A lot of times, hackers and criminals are hired in various agencies including government and law enforcement because of their skills. Ira says this is very backwards and gives examples why this is “horrendous.”</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:58] - How do we get people to not fall for various types of scams? Ira says it is a very multi-layered process and gives a few examples of what can be done.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:02] - Ira uses a comparison with terrorism attacks and how we can use that knowledge to help us protect ourselves, plan for a problem, and how to respond.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:59] - A lot of sites other than banks and credit card companies are putting in security measures to keep people safe. But a lot of people get annoyed by security protection’s inconvenience.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:15] - In general, most people use the same password across multiple accounts. If one user ID and password is compromised then the others are as well.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:32] - Ira uses the real moral of the story of The Wizard of Oz: You have what you are looking for, you just don’t know it or how to use it. This is applicable to security. You have what you are looking for, but you aren’t using it.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:38] - People have to stop being offended when people put security mechanisms in place.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:10] - Something that bothers Ira is when real credit card companies are calling and ask for points of verification like social security numbers. This is exactly what scammers do and when real companies do this, it is hard to tell the difference.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:43] - If somebody is injured, it is the fault of the system where the user exists. Somewhere they enabled the user to put themselves in a situation to allow them to be harmed.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:42] - Sometimes bad grammar and poorly written scams is actually a filtering feature for scammers to filter out the people who are too smart to fall for it. Even a small percentage of people falling for a scam is still money in the criminal’s pocket.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:44] - We need better infrastructure to protect organizations and individuals because these events cause so much money to be lost.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:46] - Anyone who tells you there can be perfect security is either a fool or a liar.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:19] - Anytime you have the option to add two-factor authorization, take it!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Information security is not just technical. There is a human aspect involved and fixing that is more than just identification and awareness. Our guest today is Ira Winkler. Ira is the president of Secure Mentem and the author of the book <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/You-CAN-Stop-Stupid-Accidental/dp/1119621984/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=ira+winkler&qid=1602558223&sr=8-4"> <em>You Can Stop Stupid</em></a><em>.</em> He is referred to as the modern-day James Bond, given his skills both physically and technically in infiltrating organizations. </p> <p>Today, Ira shares with us many of his personal and professional experiences in the area of cybercrime. His valuable tips and information can change how you look at potential threats and scams. He is an expert in how to make people easy prey and how to prevent people from being easy prey. </p> Show Notes: <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[0:51] - Ira graduated college as a psychology major and the only job he could get at that time was in the National Security Agency. This led him into the computer field within the military.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[1:31] - He always wound up working on the human side of things.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[3:03] - Ira shares his background and how he became a world-renowned penetration expert, which is a fancy name for a hacker.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[5:21] - The way you break something is not the way you fix it. This is an important concept when looking at psychology.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[7:01] - Psychology helps Ira exploit others but it is also important to understand when helping them.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[7:55] - Telling someone the problem and then telling them not to fall for a scam doesn’t work.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[8:50] - Ira and Chris discuss the recent Twitter hacks. Ira says that in this situation, anyone could have done what the hacker did because it was easy. You just have to have the questionable ethics and morals to do it.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[9:41] - A lot of times, hackers and criminals are hired in various agencies including government and law enforcement because of their skills. Ira says this is very backwards and gives examples why this is “horrendous.”</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[11:58] - How do we get people to not fall for various types of scams? Ira says it is a very multi-layered process and gives a few examples of what can be done.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[13:02] - Ira uses a comparison with terrorism attacks and how we can use that knowledge to help us protect ourselves, plan for a problem, and how to respond.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[15:59] - A lot of sites other than banks and credit card companies are putting in security measures to keep people safe. But a lot of people get annoyed by security protection’s inconvenience.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[17:15] - In general, most people use the same password across multiple accounts. If one user ID and password is compromised then the others are as well.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[18:32] - Ira uses the real moral of the story of The Wizard of Oz: You have what you are looking for, you just don’t know it or how to use it. This is applicable to security. You have what you are looking for, but you aren’t using it.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[21:38] - People have to stop being offended when people put security mechanisms in place.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[23:10] - Something that bothers Ira is when real credit card companies are calling and ask for points of verification like social security numbers. This is exactly what scammers do and when real companies do this, it is hard to tell the difference.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[25:43] - If somebody is injured, it is the fault of the system where the user exists. Somewhere they enabled the user to put themselves in a situation to allow them to be harmed.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[27:42] - Sometimes bad grammar and poorly written scams is actually a filtering feature for scammers to filter out the people who are too smart to fall for it. Even a small percentage of people falling for a scam is still money in the criminal’s pocket.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[28:44] - We need better infrastructure to protect organizations and individuals because these events cause so much money to be lost.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[29:46] - Anyone who tells you there can be perfect security is either a fool or a liar.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[30:19] - Anytime you have the option to add two-factor authorization, take it! Yes, it is annoying, but the consequences of not utilizing it are far more annoying in the end.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[32:11] - Ira shares a story about when there was suspicious activity on his bank account. He saw the pattern and told the bank that he would work with them and law enforcement because he does this for a living. They “made a note of it,” and didn’t really do anything to stop the problem.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[35:14] - Ira references a movie called <em>Focus</em> that is about scams, social engineering, and con-artists.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[37:21] - You have to admire the minds of these criminals and the lengths they’ll go to manipulate and take advantage.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[38:10] - You need to respect your potential adversaries.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[39:00] - Chris and Ira discuss why the United States is different from other countries in regards to using the combination of cards and signatures versus cards and a PIN.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[40:24] - How much risk can you assume as a culture?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[42:13] - Chip and PIN is risk mitigation, but how much risk is it actually mitigating?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[43:10] - <em>You Can Stop Stupid</em>, Ira’s book, is about how stupid is an effect, not a cause. It outlines what you can do now and how you respond to a problem.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the 2020 elections right around the corner, do you know who is trying to influence you and how they’re doing it? Listen on to learn about the ins and outs of disinformation, misinformation, interference, and influence. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Wright is an internationally recognized expert on cybersecurity strategy, cyberterrorism, and advanced technology. His landmark testimony before Congress on healthcare.gov changed how the government collected personally identifiable information. He has made hundreds of appearances on national news - radio, print, and web - and has spoken to audiences around the world. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:21] - Morgan Wright shares his background, including his childhood in a military family and his original college major as music. He moved into law enforcement and then shifted in computer crime.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:26] - Morgan moved into cybercrime because of his interest in both people and technology.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:40] - On 9/11, Morgan was supposed to be in the Pentagon but was in the Reagan building instead. Because of the attacks on 9/11, he was thrown into cyberterrorism as well.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:11] - Morgan also worked for Cisco and was the technical advisor for the show</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">America’s Most Wanted</span></em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:35] - Another facet of Morgan’s career is even working on cold case homicide files.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[8:36] - The next generation of leadership needs to be educated in technology. Every company is a software company whether you like it or not.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:36] - Disinformation is information that is intentionally changed to achieve a particular objective. The person spreading the information knows it isn’t true, but wants to incite public outrage against someone.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:06] - Misinformation is when someone hears something and believes it to be correct and shares it, to then later find out that it wasn’t accurate information.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:40] - Twitter was monitored to see how quickly disinformation and misinformation spread and it spread faster than legitimate truthful news.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:23] - Russia has been targeting people’s biases by spreading disinformation since 1917 and they understand how to take advantage of how a system works.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:56] - The real danger is when people or organizations understand how news spreads and take advantage of these algorithms to influence major decisions, events, and even human lives.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:42] - Chris and Morgan discuss Pizzagate as an example of spreading disinformation and misinformation and how the use of social media spreads it extremely fast.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:35] - Interference is a sovereignty issue. Morgan gives an example of how interference is even considered an act of war in some places.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:59] - The United States has spent a great deal of money in the influence field.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:58] - Influence is a massive social engineering operation.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:03] - Disinformation runs so deep that sometimes even trained professionals miss it.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:52] - You do not have to react to every single post you see. Take a moment to digest what you are seeing before you react to it as truth.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:44] - Parents have to be vigilant about what their kids see and read on the internet. You need to curate what your kids view and what you yourself view as well.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:08] - It is important for adults to be adults. Even with opposing views, you need to be able to be an adult and have a respectful conversation with others.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:13] - It seems that we have lost the ability to get things done with others who have opposing views.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:31] - It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has all the data. What happens is you twist facts to fit theories instead of twisting theories to fit the facts.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:13] - Nobody wants to do their own research. They just want information spoon fed to them.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:31] - The danger of conspiracy theories is that you are fed just enough kernels of truth to make it believable.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:00] - Chris and Morgan discuss a few 9/11 conspiracy theories and why it is easier to believe them than to believe the truth.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[33:47] - If you listen to the news, don’t believe a thing you hear. Do your own independent research before you share something on social media.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[35:00] - The oxygen this disinformation and influence operation needs to spread is you. It's you clicking that link and sharing it.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more and more dating moving online, how do we separate real honest people from those who are misrepresenting themselves and the outright scammers? Our guest today is Kezia Noble. Kezia is a leading female dating and attraction expert for men and author of the bestselling book</span> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076MQI2O/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Noble Art of Seducing Women.</span></em></a><em><span style= "font-weight: 400;"> </span></em></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kezia’s company helps clients learn conversation skills and ways to overcome anxiety in dating situations. Starting in 2009, she has since become a YouTube sensation. She and her team have helped over 100,000 men to overcome a multitude of sticking points and limiting beliefs, and open their eyes to the skills, techniques, insights, and secrets needed to be successful in dating. She joins us today to talk about red flags on dating apps and how you can protect yourself from potential scammers.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[0:31] - Kezia is a Dating and Attraction Expert for men. She’s been in this field for a decade and runs worldwide workshops.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:10] - Kezia helps guys with their anxiety and builds confidence in being themselves when dating.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:30] - Chris and Kezia discuss the impact Coronavirus has had on dating. Kezia is in the UK and there are fewer restrictions there now so people are back on the dating scene.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:05] - Kezia shares the differences in men and women as targets on dating apps. It is easier to target men on dating apps than women.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:30] - If a man suddenly receives many messages from a woman who is outrageously beautiful, it could be a red flag.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:10] - Kezia doesn’t use online dating because of the ease people have in lying online.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:11] - Pay attention to the messages. Are they offering you everything you want to hear? Are they avoiding an in-person meeting?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:00] - Love bombing is an attempt to influence a person by excessive attention and affection. This happens a lot with online dating.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[8:01] - When creating your profiles, you should be cautious when posting that you are looking for a serious relationship because it makes you appear vulnerable and more of a target for scammers.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:42] - Kezia creates a scenario of what she would do if she were a scammer and how some scammers can be very clever.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:28] - Chris shares a story about a previous guest who is a man in his 60’s who has seen his photo being used as a dating app scam.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:50] - If you have any inkling that someone you are messaging on a dating app is a scammer, Kezia recommends to drop a hint that you don’t have money and see what their reaction is.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:22] - Another trick is to reverse look-up a photo from a dating app. Download the person’s photo and search for it. If it shows up a lot as a stock photograph or shows up with a lot of different names, it is a red flag.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:09] - There have been situations of celebrities using dating apps and people don’t believe that they are actually who they say they are.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:27] - You should always be careful because people exaggerate online easily. This is also apparent on Instagram photos.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:06] - Even if you sit there and think that you won’t be scammed, if you are in a desperate situation, you’ll convince yourself to believe something.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:18] - The biggest red flag is when someone will never meet up in person with you.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:17] - One simple rule to live by is to never lend money to anyone you have never met.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:09] - Kezia is the type of person who is very vigilant and looks for signs of danger everywhere. This is mostly due to Kezia’s job to notice behaviors.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:17] - In Kezia’s experience, there are awful and dangerous people on dating apps, but they are in the minority. Kezia says that most people on dating apps are perfectly lovely people who are there for the right reasons.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:56] - Kezia personally does not use dating apps because she feels it is a time waster. She shares how friends of hers are exhausted from dating and that’s not how it should be.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:01] - Chris and Kezia discuss how curated social media is, specifically Instagram. Kezia doesn’t want to waste the time posing and setting up photos that aren’t authentic.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[31:38] - Social media ten years ago was a fun platform to share photos, but now social media has changed into a curated and exaggerated pretense.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[33:10] - Kezia believes social media is toxic because people are constantly fighting to appear perfect.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[34:12] - Social media is highly linked to dating. It sets up these unrealistic expectations.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[35:03] - Kezia believes that people are even staying in unhappy marriages for social media purposes. Their online life is too important to them.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[38:04] - The biggest red flag is if the potential scammer avoids meeting you in person. People question this by thinking, “What if they really are too busy?” Kezia argues that if that is the reality, then your relationship with this person is also too busy to have a real relationship with you.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[39:54] - Kezia’s business helps clients learn conversation skills and learn how to look for the right person. Commonalities breed friendships but connections breed attraction.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever received calls either at work or at home where the caller wants you to verify some information about yourself or someone else in the company? This could just be someone updating their records or it could be the start of social engineering.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our guest today is Jack Rhysider. Jack is the host of the podcast DarkNet Diaries: True Stories From the Dark Side of the Internet. His podcast is about hackers, breaches, shadow government activity, hacktivism, cybercrime, and all things that dwell on the hidden part of the net.</span></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[0:45] - Jack originally went to college to study computer engineering and wound up getting a job managing firewalls for many different clients. In that time, he went to conferences and listened to podcasts to learn about the different types of hacking.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:40] - DarkNet Diaries is a podcast of telling the stories behind hackers and different situations.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:15] - Jack explains how social engineering started decades ago where a man traveled around selling things he didn’t own.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:31] - Today’s social engineering is more about conning people within a company in order to gain access to data.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:44] - Jack breaks down the levels of people within a company and why everyone is a target for specific reasons.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:00] - Phishing is all about sending a link to someone to click that is harmful. When a phishing email is sent to a CEO, it is called Whaling.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:27] - Even the nightly cleaning crew could be a target for social engineering.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:58] - Individuals could also be hacked, especially if they use bitcoin or other form of value.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:29] - There is a difference between phishing and spear phishing. Phishing is a lot of the time random, but spear phishing is when the hacker takes the time to get to know their target.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:29] - People are the weakest link but are unintentionally the weakest link. But on the other hand, people who are aware and trained are often the strongest link in protecting companies from social engineering attempts.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:28] - Oftentimes social engineering attempts are time sensitive, so if you get an unusual call or email that is pushing you to act on something very quickly, that is a red flag.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:10] - If you get a call that you are unsure of, hang up and call the people they claim to be directly to verify their identity.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:02] - Jack recommends you also make sure you keep everything updated, like apps on your phone, your operating systems on your phone and computer, etc.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:37] - Jack also recommends using a password manager on your computer which gives you a long crazy password and remembers it. These passwords are very difficult to crack.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:44] - The harder you make it to hack your information, the more resources it would take for a hacker to gain access. They will give up and move on.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:05] - One of the biggest issues with social media is the amount of information people are giving out for free that make them vulnerable.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:18] - Jack shares a story about how Sarah Palin was hacked simply because the answers to some of her security questions were public knowledge online.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:10] - Two factors authorization is a must and Jack also recommends you take steps to secure your email addresses.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:42] - In Gmail, there is a way to see what IP addresses have accessed your email.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:50] - Jack shares a story about how he was targeted as a teenager buying a camera on eBay.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:04] - Past experiences are great lessons to learn about how to use the internet safely.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:00] - Anything that is outside of the norm, like paying a bill with a different credit card, purchasing gift cards to pay for something, or wiring money through Western Union are all big red flags.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:45] - There is a huge criminal market in India that is targeting individual people, specifically elderly people.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[31:49] - This type of awareness is the first level of security for yourself.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[33:29] - Chris and Jack discuss the most recent issue of hackers using stimulus check reasons to gain information.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[34:12] - Another recent scam is a man spamming ex-drug addicts pretending to sell pharmaceuticals to tempt them into sending money to him.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[37:32] - Jack’s podcast DarkNet Diaries covers stories from victims, law enforcement involved in cases, and even from the criminals themselves.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever received calls either at work or at home where the caller wants you to verify some information about yourself or someone else in the company? This could just be someone updating their records or it could be the start of social engineering.</p> <p>Our guest today is Jack Rhysider. Jack is the host of the podcast DarkNet Diaries: True Stories From the Dark Side of the Internet. His podcast is about hackers, breaches, shadow government activity, hacktivism, cybercrime, and all things that dwell on the hidden part of the net.</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[0:45] - Jack originally went to college to study computer engineering and wound up getting a job managing firewalls for many different clients. In that time, he went to conferences and listened to podcasts to learn about the different types of hacking.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[1:40] - DarkNet Diaries is a podcast of telling the stories behind hackers and different situations.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[2:15] - Jack explains how social engineering started decades ago where a man traveled around selling things he didn’t own.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[3:31] - Today’s social engineering is more about conning people within a company in order to gain access to data.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[4:44] - Jack breaks down the levels of people within a company and why everyone is a target for specific reasons.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[5:00] - Phishing is all about sending a link to someone to click that is harmful. When a phishing email is sent to a CEO, it is called Whaling.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[7:27] - Even the nightly cleaning crew could be a target for social engineering.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[7:58] - Individuals could also be hacked, especially if they use bitcoin or other form of value.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[9:29] - There is a difference between phishing and spear phishing. Phishing is a lot of the time random, but spear phishing is when the hacker takes the time to get to know their target.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[11:29] - People are the weakest link but are unintentionally the weakest link. But on the other hand, people who are aware and trained are often the strongest link in protecting companies from social engineering attempts.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[12:28] - Oftentimes social engineering attempts are time sensitive, so if you get an unusual call or email that is pushing you to act on something very quickly, that is a red flag.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[14:10] - If you get a call that you are unsure of, hang up and call the people they claim to be directly to verify their identity.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[16:02] - Jack recommends you also make sure you keep everything updated, like apps on your phone, your operating systems on your phone and computer, etc.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[16:37] - Jack also recommends using a password manager on your computer which gives you a long crazy password and remembers it. These passwords are very difficult to crack.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[17:44] - The harder you make it to hack your information, the more resources it would take for a hacker to gain access. They will give up and move on.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[18:05] - One of the biggest issues with social media is the amount of information people are giving out for free that make them vulnerable.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[20:18] - Jack shares a story about how Sarah Palin was hacked simply because the answers to some of her security questions were public knowledge online.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[21:10] - Two factors authorization is a must and Jack also recommends you take steps to secure your email addresses.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[23:42] - In Gmail, there is a way to see what IP addresses have accessed your email.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[25:50] - Jack shares a story about how he was targeted as a teenager buying a camera on eBay.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[27:04] - Past experiences are great lessons to learn about how to use the internet safely.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[29:00] - Anything that is outside of the norm, like paying a bill with a different credit card, purchasing gift cards to pay for something, or wiring money through Western Union are all big red flags.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[29:45] - There is a huge criminal market in India that is targeting individual people, specifically elderly people.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[31:49] - This type of awareness is the first level of security for yourself.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[33:29] - Chris and Jack discuss the most recent issue of hackers using stimulus check reasons to gain information.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[34:12] - Another recent scam is a man spamming ex-drug addicts pretending to sell pharmaceuticals to tempt them into sending money to him.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[37:32] - Jack’s podcast DarkNet Diaries covers stories from victims, law enforcement involved in cases, and even from the criminals themselves.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your reputation or the reputation of your business gets trashed online, it can have a lasting impact. But there are things that you can do</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">today</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">to limit the impact of negative online statements about you and some of them are easier than you might expect. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our guest today is Chris Silver Smith. Chris is the CEO of Argent Media, a marketing agency focused heavily on reputation management where Chris helps people clean up their reputations in search engines. Chris has also served as an expert witness in defamation lawsuits in state and federal court. In his long time column at Search Engine Land, he has advocated for reputation victims.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:00] - Chris started his career in internet marketing and designing. He also worked for Verizon for many years and eventually made his way into researching and developing SEO (search engine optimization).</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:28] - After working for Verizon, he moved on to working for SEO companies and became intrigued by reputation management which was predicted to be fast-growing.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:37] - Reputation management is compelling to Chris because of the personal stories that get involved with it.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:20] - Reputation management could mean helping companies whose CEOs may have made a social media mistake or even smaller companies who have negative reviews.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:48] - Chris shares a story about a CEO who was accused of many things by an escort and truly had not done the things he was accused of.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:50] - Sometimes the bad reputation is because of actual unwise decisions that people have made.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:35] - Chris says that his most memorable personal case was a porn revenge situation who was a trafficking victim. Chris wound up working as an expert witness for free.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:30] - The woman did eventually get away from her harasser and he followed through with his threats of ruining her reputation. But she won the lawsuit and felt that her negative reputation was completely created by her harasser.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:40] - There are more common reputation management cases that Chris has seen several times, such as college or high school students getting in trouble with the police.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:21] - When I say reputation management, usually that means something bad appears when you google someone’s name.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:33] - Chris has dealt many times with fake mugshot sites that post mugshots and charge a fee for people to take them down.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:45] - After Google de-optimized these mugshot sites, it is easier to take these posts down with Chris’s help.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:39] - There’s so much out there and it is so easy to defame people on the internet.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:11] - Chris references the story of the sex trafficking victim to answer how some of these reputation management victims don’t care about the money. They really want their reputation cleared and prove that the accusations are false.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:10] - People who have had their reputation damaged or attacked often have a really severe emotional response to it and are referred to counseling.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:20] - People are surprised at how easy it is for their reputation to suddenly become tarnished.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:24] - It is important to know the difference between your public persona and a private one and curate what you put up publicly. Maintaining this can come in handy when your reputation is attacked.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:34] - Chris shares a story about a competitor who purchased the domain name for his new business and how he was able to amicably solve the problem.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:04] - A strong online presence is a good idea. You should have a personal website and periodically Google your name.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:50] - Chris recommends using Tumblr, Flickr, and YouTube under your name that could help create an online presence that would show up in the search results.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:31] - Even informal stuff is great for basic SEO. Use your name as often as you can.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:00] - It may feel like you’re overhyping yourself, but that’s optimization. Search engines work off text.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:02] - Facebook is great because you can have a personal page for friends and family but can simultaneously have a business page.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[31:47] - Chris shares many examples of common mistakes people make when video and audio is being recorded.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:50] - Remember that every single thing you do publicly now is likely to be recorded and can be uploaded either on purpose or accidentally.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[33:10] - Chris shares a story of employees who were connected to a man who ran a cult. They disclosed it and moved on.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[35:02] - Chris’s wife’s name is Karen and now there are many memes and negativity surrounding the name.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[36:51] - There are quite a few businesses out there that accidentally get sucked into the news because of their names when they really have no connection. Chris calls this name collision.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[38:39] - There is a cost with fixing a damaged reputation and sometimes it is less costly to change names and move on.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[39:47] - Chris has worked cases with restaurant chains that has actually resulted in some policy change within the companies.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[42:32] - It is better to get ahead of the curve if you can.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[43:40] - It is good to go ahead and claim your name for a personal webpage and on social media in case you ever need it. Prepare and protect your reputation upfront instead of fixing it later on.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

They really want their reputation cleared and prove that the accusations are false.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[20:10] - People who have had their reputation damaged or attacked often have a really severe emotional response to it and are referred to counseling.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[21:20] - People are surprised at how easy it is for their reputation to suddenly become tarnished.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[22:24] - It is important to know the difference between your public persona and a private one and curate what you put up publicly. Maintaining this can come in handy when your reputation is attacked.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[23:34] - Chris shares a story about a competitor who purchased the domain name for his new business and how he was able to amicably solve the problem.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[26:04] - A strong online presence is a good idea. You should have a personal website and periodically Google your name.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[26:50] - Chris recommends using Tumblr, Flickr, and YouTube under your name that could help create an online presence that would show up in the search results.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[28:31] - Even informal stuff is great for basic SEO. Use your name as often as you can.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[29:00] - It may feel like you’re overhyping yourself, but that’s optimization. Search engines work off text.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[30:02] - Facebook is great because you can have a personal page for friends and family but can simultaneously have a business page.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[31:47] - Chris shares many examples of common mistakes people make when video and audio is being recorded.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[32:50] - Remember that every single thing you do publicly now is likely to be recorded and can be uploaded either on purpose or accidentally.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[33:10] - Chris shares a story of employees who were connected to a man who ran a cult. They disclosed it and moved on.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[35:02] - Chris’s wife’s name is Karen and now there are many memes and negativity surrounding the name.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[36:51] - There are quite a few businesses out there that accidentally get sucked into the news because of their names when they really have no connection. Chris calls this name collision.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[38:39] - There is a cost with fixing a damaged reputation and sometimes it is less costly to change names and move on.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[39:47] - Chris has worked cases with restaurant chains that has actually resulted in some policy change within the companies.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[42:32] - It is better to get ahead of the curve if you can.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[43:40] - It is good to go ahead and claim your name for a personal webpage and on social media in case you ever need it. Prepare and protect your reputation upfront instead of fixing it later on.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conspiracy theories are all crazy, right? Well, maybe not. There’s some history as to why so many people believe in them. What we really need is a conspiracy theory detection kit and that’s what we have in today’s episode.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our guest today is Dr. Michael Shermer. Dr. Shermer is the founding publisher of Skeptic Magazine, the host of the Science Salon Podcast, and a presidential fellow at Chapman University where he teaches Skepticism 101. For 18 years he was a monthly columnist for Scientific American.

We can’t know anything with certainty. Most of the decisions we make in life are made with uncertainty. So how best should we best make decisions?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:39] - For centuries, we have developed methods, tools, and technology to help us with this problem of uncertainty.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:47] - Finding the cause of something has many variables and once you start getting into economics and politics, things get messy.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:50] - It is important to separate the correlation between seemingly cause and effect relationships. Dr. Shermer uses the fraudulent connection between vaccines and autism to demonstrate.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:48] - The curse of knowledge is the Hindsight Bias. After the fact, it is clear what should have been done, but at the time it wasn’t clear. Dr. Shermer shares several great historical events as examples of this.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:27] - There’s</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">let</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">something happen on purpose and</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">make</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">something happen on purpose and it is unfair to place blame on others using the Hindsight Bias.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:40] - There is a difference between</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">conspiracy</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">conspiracy theory.</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">A conspiracy is something that actually happened and a conspiracy theory is the idea that there is something that is happening.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:08] - The main reason people believe conspiracy theories are true is because many shocking conspiracies have actually happened. They are not so far out of the realm of possibility.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:55] - It is not completely crazy to think that something will happen because historically something similar</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">has</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">happened. Dr. Shermer uses examples from the Kennedy administration.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:49] - Another reason people are quick to believe conspiracy theories is because of the messiness of the world. Our brains are wired to try to simplify things.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:39] - Money is a proxy for power and a lot of people believe that these people who have power are actually more powerful than they are. For example, Bill Gates is the center of some conspiracy theories, but in reality, what power does he actually have?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:10] - This is not unreasonable for people to believe because there have been powerful people with money who have rigged the system.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:58] - It is easier to believe that horrific things that happen in the world are controlled by a small group of people. This is an example of the human brain trying to simplify things.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:17] - The fact is, nobody is running the world. And in a way, that is scary.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:27] - The more people that have to be involved, the less likely the conspiracy is true. People don’t typically keep secrets and have big mouths.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:56] - Dr. Shermer uses a 9/11 conspiracy theory as an example of how crazy the theory sounds due to its complexity.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:05] - Some conspiracy theories are harmless, but many can be harmful.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:40] - An example of a dangerous conspiracy theory is the one surrounding Hitler’s rise to power. Hitler’s initial platform was spreading the conspiracy theory that the only reason they lost the first world war was because they were stabbed in the back by the Jewish community.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:25] - People are very confused about the term freedom. You have to give up certain freedoms for security.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:54] - The United States and Italy are examples of countries with a loose culture. This means that they are not rigidly following guidelines and the spread of COVID-19 is rapid in nations like this.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:12] - Chris and Dr. Shermer discuss the title of Dr. Shermer’s new book</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Giving the Devil His Due</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">which was inspired by the play</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Man For All Seasons</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Robert Bolt.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:12] - The book is a series of essays on the theme of free speech.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:27] - The only way to make sure you haven’t gone off the rails and believe things that aren’t true is to interact with people who think differently from you.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long gone are the days of companies giving away coolers on college campuses when students would sign up for high-interest credit cards. Unfortunately, there are still sneaky promotions, fine print, and ways these companies take advantage of unsuspecting customers. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our guest today is Sara Rathner. Sara is a NerdWallet travel and credit cards expert. She appeared on the</span> <a href= "https://www.today.com/video/last-minute-advice-for-filing-your-2018-taxes-1490956355665"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Today Show</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">,</span> <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=771359666581259&ref=watch_permalink"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasdaq</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">, and</span> <a href= "http://nbr.com/2019/05/17/credit-card-rates-raising-delinquencies-among-millennials/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">CNBC’s Nightly Business Report</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and has been quoted in Yahoo Finance, Time, Business Insider, and MarketWatch. She’s held a total of 23 credit cards using travel reward points to see the world on a budget. A proud Northwestern University alum, she also has a certificate in financial planning from Boston University. She’s here today to talk about personal finance scams and how to manage your credit cards.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:40] - Sara’s passion is personal finance and people reach out to her to ask questions. She really wants finances to be empowering and not scary.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:04] - Chris remembers the days when he was in college seeing booths of credit card companies setting college students up with credit cards. Sara explains the Card Act that changed the law to protect young adults.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:31] - There are times when your credit limit can really help you in a bind.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:10] - Sara recommends everyone read the fine print of every credit card you apply for, even though it is not enjoyable to do so. You can find all this information before you even fill out an application.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:06] - You want to find a card that provides greater value than its annual cost. You want to find a card that has rewards that you will actually redeem and use.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:32] - The credit card industry is seeing a lot of change due to the pandemic.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:29] - Sara explains how revolving credit accounts work and where credit card balances can get dicey.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:14] - If you pay your credit card bills every month rather than the minimum payment, you won’t deal with interest.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:00] - Chris shares an experience of reading the fine print on a store credit card application that claimed to be interest-free for the first 12 months. Sara confirms how that works and cautions people to know that fine print.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:30] - Interest rates are negotiable to an extent.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:11] - Missing a payment is huge. Many cards have late fees and a late payment could hit your credit score by 100 points or more overnight.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:05] - The thing that you need or want now is great, but if it causes you long term financial struggle, oftentimes it wasn’t worth it in the first place.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:23] - Sara recommends for those really large purchases to save up money rather than taking on the stress of debt if you can.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:30] - There are a lot of recent scams, specifically small business loans and unemployment insurance, that are popping up after the pandemic caused people to lose their job and reliable income.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:05] - Sara recommends going directly to the government agencies that offer financial assistance during this time and never to go to an outside source no matter how legitimate they appear.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:58] - Sara shares an experience with a credit card company contacting her about a problem with her account and asked her for her credit card number to verify. She refused and called the number on the back of her card to make sure.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:13] - Any time you are trying to buy and sell items on platforms like Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace, be very careful because there are scams there, too.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:07] - It is much more important to be careful and seem paranoid than take a risk. You’re dealing with strangers so their opinion doesn’t matter.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:06] - Chris and Sara discuss sketchy ways scammers try to snag you. But there are legitimate credit repair resources online and many of them are free.</span> <a href= "https://www.nerdwallet.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">NerdWallet</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">is an excellent resource.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:49] - It takes a few months for positive behaviors to show up on your credit reports, so if you stick with it you will be rewarded.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:27] - NerdWallet is your financial best friend that has tons of great articles and calculators.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To what extremes are you willing to go for complete privacy and security? No one takes privacy as seriously as today’s guest, John McAfee.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John McAfee is known for founding McAfee Antivirus, being a crypto currency evangelist and a privacy activist. In this episode, John shares the lengths he goes to protect his own privacy with significant unexpected costs. John lives and plays by his own rules and this interview is no exception. If you are sensitive to profanity, I suggest that you head over to EasyPrey.com/26 for a clean transcript.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen on to find out how John maintains his extremely private lifestyle.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:12] - John McAfee begins explaining the precautions he takes to keep his privacy safe by stating that he and his wife do not own cell phones.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:39] - Even with a brand new mobile phone, when you call just three people, a government could find you and John explains how cell phones are susceptible to spyware.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:05] - John also explains that he lives in a faraday cage, which blocks signals from coming in and out of the room. It is also sound proof.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:52] - John also has a very serious VPN that goes through 9 different countries to ensure his privacy.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:41] - While on trips and vacations, John and his wife take many pictures but don’t post them immediately. This keeps people guessing where they actually are at any given time.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:42] - John also adds bogus information to photos that are posted, like varying dates.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:19] - Chris asks John how he feels about Tor and John explains that it was infiltrated by the CIA so it isn’t possible to have any privacy or anonymity.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:13] - If it is advertised at all, it is something that is owned by somebody and there is no privacy there.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:09] - John explains that the only secure email out there is Google and it is also not very secure either.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:37] - Google never trusts anybody. As long as they get their money, they’re happy and they’ll give you what privacy they can, given the constraints of reality.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:58] - If you want any privacy at all, there’s no way to do that other than Gmail.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:40] - John explains that he does not have a bank account or credit cards. He strictly uses cryptocurrency only, including large purchases like homes and cars.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:50] - He is also particular on what cryptocurrency he uses and does not suggest using large or older companies like Bitcoin.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:07] - Bitcoin specifically is easily tracked and can be followed.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:00] - The newer cryptocurrency companies are much better about keeping your information safe and private.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:54] - John explains how when moving from country to country, he has multiple legal passports.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:56] - Because he is frequently recognized when he’s with his wife, they split up when traveling and meet up later.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To what extremes are you willing to go for complete privacy and security? No one takes privacy as seriously as today’s guest, John McAfee.</p> <p>John McAfee is known for founding McAfee Antivirus, being a crypto currency evangelist and a privacy activist. In this episode, John shares the lengths he goes to protect his own privacy with significant unexpected costs. John lives and plays by his own rules and this interview is no exception. If you are sensitive to profanity, I suggest that you head over to EasyPrey.com/26 for a clean transcript.</p> <p>Listen on to find out how John maintains his extremely private lifestyle.</p> Show Notes: <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[1:12] - John McAfee begins explaining the precautions he takes to keep his privacy safe by stating that he and his wife do not own cell phones.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[1:39] - Even with a brand new mobile phone, when you call just three people, a government could find you and John explains how cell phones are susceptible to spyware.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[2:05] - John also explains that he lives in a faraday cage, which blocks signals from coming in and out of the room. It is also sound proof.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[2:52] - John also has a very serious VPN that goes through 9 different countries to ensure his privacy.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[4:41] - While on trips and vacations, John and his wife take many pictures but don’t post them immediately. This keeps people guessing where they actually are at any given time.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[5:42] - John also adds bogus information to photos that are posted, like varying dates.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[7:19] - Chris asks John how he feels about Tor and John explains that it was infiltrated by the CIA so it isn’t possible to have any privacy or anonymity.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[9:13] - If it is advertised at all, it is something that is owned by somebody and there is no privacy there.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[10:09] - John explains that the only secure email out there is Google and it is also not very secure either.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[10:37] - Google never trusts anybody. As long as they get their money, they’re happy and they’ll give you what privacy they can, given the constraints of reality.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[10:58] - If you want any privacy at all, there’s no way to do that other than Gmail.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[11:40] - John explains that he does not have a bank account or credit cards. He strictly uses cryptocurrency only, including large purchases like homes and cars.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[12:50] - He is also particular on what cryptocurrency he uses and does not suggest using large or older companies like Bitcoin.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[14:07] - Bitcoin specifically is easily tracked and can be followed.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[15:00] - The newer cryptocurrency companies are much better about keeping your information safe and private.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[17:54] - John explains how when moving from country to country, he has multiple legal passports.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[19:56] - Because he is frequently recognized when he’s with his wife, they split up when traveling and meet up later. He wears hats, hoodies, various glasses, and due to Covid-19, masks. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[21:40] - John also makes sure to lie to his friends and family as well so that his location at any given time is not revealed.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[24:01] - John explains how the costs of good privacy are very steep.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[25:06] - How important is this level of privacy to the average person? John doesn’t advise this lifestyle for anybody. But for John and his wife Janice, it is critical.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[25:50] - Striking a balance is tough, specifically if you own a smartphone.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[27:45] - All this possible tracking done by smart phones is granted access by the actual user. You sign up to be spied on.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[29:21] - John feels that he has to live the way he does in order to not be silenced by government agencies who don’t want him spreading what he knows to be the truth.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[31:50] - John founded his computer security company by understanding the reality of the world.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[34:04] - When asked about Julian Assange, John says, “A hero is someone capable of accomplishing.” John says Assange and Snowden are both very smart but were not prepared.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[35:41] - John has been arrested 21 times in 11 different countries but because of how he chooses to live in private seclusion, he is free to speak out.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty years ago, cybersecurity was something that only nerds talked about. Now cybersecurity has gone mainstream. Listen in as we talk about common scams, the recent Twitter hack, and organized crime with Graham Cluley from</span> <a href= "https://grahamcluley.com/podcasts/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">The Smashing Security Podcast.</span></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graham Cluley has been working in the computer security industry since the early 1990’s. He was in senior roles with Sophos and McAfee. In 2011, he was inducted into the</span> <a href= "https://www.infosecurityeurope.com/conference/hall-of-fame/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Infosecurity Europe Hall of Fame</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">. Graham runs his own award-winning computer security</span> <a href="https://grahamcluley.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">blog</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">and hosts the</span> <a href= "https://grahamcluley.com/podcasts/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Smashing Security Podcast</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">which has been a successful cybersecurity podcast since 2016.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join us as we discuss cybersecurity threats both past and present and learn more about how to protect yourself, your business, and your loved ones.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:00] - Graham shares how he started in the cybersecurity business as a poor college student who created Shareware games. Someone sent him a package with a job offer with an anti-virus company.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[2:46] - When Graham began working, there were about 200 new computer viruses per month and had to send out anti-virus updates through the mail on a floppy disk.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:27] - Today there are literally hundreds of thousands of new pieces of malware being written everyday. In the blink of an eye there’s more than one new piece of malware released.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:01] - We see much more organized crime and state sponsored cybercrime these days.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:59] - Back in the day, hackers tended to be young people writing malware to show off. But now, malware is harder to detect because they don’t want to be detected.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:45] - Graham shares a story about The New York Times being targeted and hacked. Hackers were able to see articles and information as they were being drafted, including information on secret informants.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:05] - Don’t be too complacent and assume that you won’t ever be targeted due to lack of interest in your company. Hackers may not be interested in your company, but may be interested in your suppliers or customers.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:35] - Business email compromise scams are when hackers get into a business email account and can see correspondence. They then can jump into the thread and can pose as an employee or contractor to receive funds. Businesses have lost millions to this scam.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:50] - You can have all the defenses in place, all the layers of security, and all the patches in place, but you can’t patch the human brain.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:40] - Email compromise scams are very simple but successful and a huge threat.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:51] - Have a procedure set up where it is okay to say no to senior management so when a scam email comes through suggesting a break to a rule, an employee can say no and avoid a problem.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:31] - Graham and Chris discuss the recent bitcoin Twitter hack, which included big name accounts like Barack Obama and Bill Gates.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:39] - The Twitter hackers social engineered people by emailing them posing as a Twitter IT department member. They convinced them to type their information into a fake site that appeared to be Twitter and while doing so, the hackers gained access to their real accounts.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:19] - Similar to the recent Twitter hacks, scammers have been known to pose as your bank and gain access to your accounts.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:28] - The saddest part about cybercrime is the effect it has had on average people becoming petrified of learning new technology.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:44] - Graham recommends products like iPads or Chromebooks for basic computer use because they are more locked down. Although there are still risks, these are great options.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:21] - Because of new Covid-19 websites, anti-virus companies were being notified of suspicious behavior because the websites were so new.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:32] - Short Twitter names are more likely to be targeted than the more difficult long ones.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:48] - Graham explains the problem of organized cybercrime that produces targeted attacks through malware designed to steal data from their targeted company.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:32] - Garmin was targeted by an organized cybercrime entity called Evil Corp and they were ransomed for ten million dollars.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:05] - Evil Corp is led by Maksim V. Yakubets in Russia.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[35:40] - VPN companies can be created and run by organized cybercrime entities.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[36:31] - There are situations where using a VPN is fine, such as using one to access streaming content.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[38:40] - If you’re in your home and you trust your internet service provider, you won’t need to use a VPN.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[39:33] - Graham says to stay abreast of security news and listen to Smashing Security. It is a lighthearted take on cybersecurity.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the coronavirus pandemic, we’ve rapidly changed the way we work, how we play, and how we’re educated. This sudden shift leaves us and our families exposed to privacy and security risks we previously hadn’t thought about or planned for. Listen up for any blindspots you might have.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our guest today is Rebecca Herold. Rebecca, also known as The Privacy Professor, has over 25 years of experience in system engineering, information security privacy, and compliance. She has authored 19 books with the 20th on its way. She has been a member of the NIST CyberSecurity IOT Development Team, and was an adjunct professor for Norwich University’s Masters of Science in Information and Security and Assurance Program for 9 years. Today she will share with us her experiences with privacy and security and will also share things for you to keep in mind when using various apps and services.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:06] - Rebecca started out as a systems engineer in 1988 and around 1990 got into system security and established security systems for banks.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:50] - Rebecca created her own consulting company and began teaching as an adjunct professor at Norwich University. Her adjunct professor position helped her learn even more about the practicality and various needs in security.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:40] - When you have a career in which you use technology that is constantly changing, it keeps things interesting. Rebecca has had to constantly adapt and learn.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[7:20] - Risks don’t go away. You just accumulate new ones that you have to keep addressing. That’s something that many security and privacy practitioners forget. They keep up to date on new risks but sometimes forget the existing ones.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:32] - Privacy tends to be an afterthought and we need to shift our thinking to start setting up security and privacy controls from the beginning.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:30] - Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Rebecca has gotten a lot of questions from business owners regarding their employees and how to gain information on them to remain safe and help manage their self-insured expenses.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:40] - Some business owners are trying to bypass doctors and healthcare professionals because they are self-insured. They also want to know where their employees have been to avoid them coming in with COVID-19. These are huge privacy issues.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:24] - “COVID tracker apps” may be used by business owners to try to avoid their insurance rates going up. These examples show the problem with tracker apps not being used transparently.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:01] - There are hundreds of these COVID tracking apps and some were built with privacy and security integrated but many were not.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:24] - Always think about apps and what data they might be collecting.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:23] - Rebecca gives examples of apps asking for information that is unnecessary for tracking COVID-19, such as your exact date of birth.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:42] - There are situations where apps are being portrayed and communicated to users that privacy and security are built in, however a lot of privacy features have been overlooked.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:22] - We need to get this pandemic under control and have insights, but we don’t want to create other problems. There has to be a balance. What can we do to track this but keep people’s privacy safe?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:35] - Always ask yourself why is this information necessary when signing up for various apps and websites.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:62] - If people are asking you for information and it's not necessary for the purpose in which you are using a service or product, you don’t have to give it to them.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:20] - Social media has a long way to go. They’ve been around a while, but they have to be the “latest and the greatest” to stay in business.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:33] - With so many people working from home right now, people don’t realize that their home environment is much different than the private and secure environment in the workplace.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[31:40] - Zoom became the go-to site for online education and business meetings, but meetings are not always secure.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[34:00] - Because you’re participating in a meeting from home, other people involved can see the inside or outside of your home and may use that information maliciously.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[35:40] - Rebecca shares examples of smart toys and apps being used maliciously.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[37:50] - In your workplace, there are security measures in place and IT professionals available to make sure things are working smoothly. But that isn’t the case at home.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[39:01] - Part of Rebecca’s job is to find open access points to demonstrate to clients how this information can be used.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[41:10] - Rebecca shares the possibility of people accessing baby monitors and home security cameras through open access points.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[42:39] - With remote learning going on, teachers and students need to have some basic training on privacy and security measures such as multi-factor authorization and understanding devices like Amazon Echo.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[45:06] - Rebecca shares examples of smart toys and devices that are listening and recording data, even though they are advertised to only respond to key words. These types of devices should be shut off when students are learning from home.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[46:52] - Social engineering is a big concern with online education and parents need to be aware of possibilities and educate their children. This could include strangers coming into contact through an online video conference or even sharing files.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[48:34] - Privacy and security is a lot for people to learn in a very short period of time.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[49:24] - The environment your child is learning in from home should be similar to the environment in their classroom. This is applicable to work-from-home environments as well.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[50:15] - Rebecca shares an experience with the president of a South American country using video footage from the president’s son with which people could gather many pieces of private information.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[51:32] - There’s so many possibilities that people don’t think about before they naively show where they’re at.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[52:51] - When Rebecca shares herself through a webcam in her home office, she uses privacy screens to prevent people from seeing her home behind her.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[53:40] - Rebecca recommends keeping your webcam disconnected until you need to use it because some apps are given access to your webcam that you may not realize.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[54:22] - Taking a little bit of precaution will prevent you from someday saying “Why didn’t I just do that?” when faced with a privacy problem.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[56:09] - Rebecca Herold is currently in the final editing of a new book called</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Security and Privacy When Working From Home and Traveling,</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">which spans 23 chapters of privacy, security, and compliance risks with real-world examples.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

He has spoken at numerous security conferences including Black Hat. He has spent 20 years doing investigation work on cybercrime threats.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John is going to go over what Stalkerware is, in what scenarios it is most common, and things we can do to mitigate the harm it can do.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[1:00] - John Bambenek is the Vice President of Security Research and Intelligence at ThreatSTOP and owns his own company, Bambenek Consulting. He has been working in cybersecurity since college.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:01] - John explains that Stalkerware is a malicious mobile app that is put on your phone to track your movements, monitor who you are talking to, see your texts, and other various activities through your phone.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[3:26] - Stalkerware is most commonly found in cases of former relationships, but John shares his experience with Stalkerware found on the mobile device of an assassinated politician in South America.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[4:39] - Odds are, if there is Stalkerware on your phone or mobile device, that that is not all that is going on. There are usually many signs of abusive or controlling behavior.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[5:45] - There are also ways that people can be stalked without installing Stalkerware, such as monitoring Instagram and Facebook activity.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[6:29] - Multiple IP addresses and their locations are often misinterpreted.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:14] - Stalkerware is most commonly installed onto someone’s phone by someone who has physical access to it, although remote installation is possible.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:58] - There are also built-in features that can be misused, such as Find My Friends on an iPhone.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:18] - Stalkerware is different from malware that is accidentally downloaded where hackers may have access to a device belonging to someone they don’t know. Stalkerware is intentional and usually involves some prior relationship.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:08] - Whenever you can, have a password on your phone that you don’t give to someone, multi-factor authentication on accounts and other important logins.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:50] - Multi-factor authentication is a very useful early warning system. John shares an experience he had in another country and how multi-factor authentication helped catch something unusual early on.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:07] - John is a unique case because he</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">wants</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a device compromised to aid him in his career in security research and shares some stories about his experiences.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:12] - Chris and John discuss devices to bring or not to bring to conferences like Black Hat.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:52] - A factory reset and changing all passwords is largely sufficient in eliminating Stalkerware installed on a phone.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:28] - Once you start getting real-world indication that you are being stalked, establishing a police report is an important next step.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:28] - With effort and with a court order, it may be possible to determine who has installed the Stalkerware on your device if you don’t know who it is.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:31] - One thing to keep in mind is when you wipe the phone, you also wipe the evidence.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:13] - Taking down the people who create these Stalkerware malware is more valuable to police and investigators than individual cases of Stalkerware.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:23] - The Coalition Against Stalkerware is a community of activists providing resources to victims and who are trying to figure out what can be done about Stalkerware on a larger scale.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:30] - Language needs to be precise because there are software creators whose intentions are not malicious.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[31:40] - There are laws that need to be changed and police detectives need to be educated so they can become experts in examining mobile phones.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[33:00] - John explains that if you give someone access to your phone years ago and then they install Stalkerware on your phone maliciously later, they will not go to jail for it because you gave them permission at some point.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[34:43] - There are industry coalitions and other groups dedicated to helping victims of stalking, but stalking has been a prevalent behavior in long term documented history. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[35:27] - There are people who want these tools to monitor and control someone’s movements and there are people who want to make money by providing this malware to them.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[36:01] - There are lots of ways someone can be stalked without the use of Stalkerware. Because of the nature of social media sites like Facebook, we are leaking information all the time that can be watched and used.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[37:41] - People don’t understand the difference between anonymous and private. John gives examples of how this can be a problem.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[39:10] - To get the benefits of advancing technology, we have to give up something in exchange. These things are not necessarily good or bad, you just need to understand what you’re giving up to have this service.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[40:16] - Every decision has its pros and cons and you have to be mindful of what they are and be okay with that. And sometimes there are ways to mitigate some of those harms.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[40:40] - John explains the problem with Bluetooth: We have so many devices and it's all or nothing.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[43:16] - There are many contact tracing apps that are created for a legitimate purpose that can be misused for the purpose of stalking.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been telling people for years that they need to implement two-factor authentication wherever possible.  Now that you’ve done that, imagine the havoc that would happen if those security codes were sent to somebody else enabling them to access your email, social media accounts, and worse your bank accounts. It is called SIM swapping, porting out, and SIM jacking. Today’s guest is Haseeb Awan. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haseeb is CEO of Efani, American’s most secure and private cell phone service. He is an expert at protecting high profile individual cell phone numbers. Haseeb was also co-founder of the first bitcoin ATM company. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haseeb shares his many experiences with working with SIM swapping. We talk about how we are all at risk and the precautions we can take to avoid becoming a victim of SIM swapping. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[01:26] - SIM swap, SIM port, SIM hack, and telephone takeover are all the same.  SIM swapping is when a criminal takes over your telephone.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[02:05] - The criminal takes control of your social media accounts or email accounts and then drains your bank account.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[04:06] - If a person gets your account number, pin number, and telephone number and then the criminal can transfer your phone number.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:36] - Often they go online and buy a new SIM card and trick someone to transfer the number to them.   </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[06:51] - Social engineering is as simple as pretending to be someone you are not to gain information maliciously or for fun.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[08:05] - Telephone companies have the ability to sell, monetize, and track your data.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:47] - If I haven’t done anything wrong then why do I need privacy?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:49] - The people that are criminals are working 24/7 to destroy you. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:31] - The average customer is more at risk because they don’t take as many precautions.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:41] - Make sure your cell phone carrier supports a pin code at a minimum.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:30] - Whatever setting you have the criminal can override.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:42] - The port lock might help keep your number from being taken to a different carrier, but if they go to your carrier’s store it doesn’t help at all.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:58] - These criminals only need a few hours to have complete access to everything.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:36] - Often they attack when you are most vulnerable like after 9 PM in the evening.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:16] - You should always use an app-based or hardware key vs. SMS two-factor identification. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:32] - Keep it simple and have a password on your phone and then use the Google authenticator app.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:52] - We often get attacked because we are lazy and put security off until tomorrow.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:22] - Efani focuses on pricing and security. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:18] - Most of their customers are people who don’t want their information sold on the internet and want that extra layer of security. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:15] - Doctors are the number one victims of SIM swapping attacks.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:40] - Seniors are at a significantly higher risk.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[31:19] - It is really easy to forge caller id, so never assume it is a real call. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:25] - Within 90 days you will see a 90% reduction in spam calls with Efani.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[33:27] - When you have a cell phone plan try not to be on a family plan.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[33:47] - The two most important numbers in your life are your social security number and your cell phone number and you have way more linked to your cell phone number.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[34:14] - He suggests getting two telephone numbers.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been telling people for years that they need to implement two-factor authentication wherever possible.  Now that you’ve done that, imagine the havoc that would happen if those security codes were sent to somebody else enabling them to access your email, social media accounts, and worse your bank accounts. It is called SIM swapping, porting out, and SIM jacking. Today’s guest is Haseeb Awan. </p> <p>Haseeb is CEO of Efani, American’s most secure and private cell phone service. He is an expert at protecting high profile individual cell phone numbers. Haseeb was also co-founder of the first bitcoin ATM company. </p> <p>Haseeb shares his many experiences with working with SIM swapping. We talk about how we are all at risk and the precautions we can take to avoid becoming a victim of SIM swapping. </p> Show Notes: <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[01:26] - SIM swap, SIM port, SIM hack, and telephone takeover are all the same.  SIM swapping is when a criminal takes over your telephone.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[02:05] - The criminal takes control of your social media accounts or email accounts and then drains your bank account.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[04:06] - If a person gets your account number, pin number, and telephone number and then the criminal can transfer your phone number.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[05:36] - Often they go online and buy a new SIM card and trick someone to transfer the number to them.   </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[06:51] - Social engineering is as simple as pretending to be someone you are not to gain information maliciously or for fun.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[08:05] - Telephone companies have the ability to sell, monetize, and track your data.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[10:47] - If I haven’t done anything wrong then why do I need privacy?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[11:49] - The people that are criminals are working 24/7 to destroy you. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[13:31] - The average customer is more at risk because they don’t take as many precautions.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[14:41] - Make sure your cell phone carrier supports a pin code at a minimum.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[16:30] - Whatever setting you have the criminal can override.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[19:42] - The port lock might help keep your number from being taken to a different carrier, but if they go to your carrier’s store it doesn’t help at all.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[19:58] - These criminals only need a few hours to have complete access to everything.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[20:36] - Often they attack when you are most vulnerable like after 9 PM in the evening.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[21:16] - You should always use an app-based or hardware key vs. SMS two-factor identification. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[23:32] - Keep it simple and have a password on your phone and then use the Google authenticator app.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[24:52] - We often get attacked because we are lazy and put security off until tomorrow.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[26:22] - Efani focuses on pricing and security. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[27:18] - Most of their customers are people who don’t want their information sold on the internet and want that extra layer of security. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[28:15] - Doctors are the number one victims of SIM swapping attacks.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[29:40] - Seniors are at a significantly higher risk.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[31:19] - It is really easy to forge caller id, so never assume it is a real call. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[32:25] - Within 90 days you will see a 90% reduction in spam calls with Efani.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[33:27] - When you have a cell phone plan try not to be on a family plan.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[33:47] - The two most important numbers in your life are your social security number and your cell phone number and you have way more linked to your cell phone number.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[34:14] - He suggests getting two telephone numbers.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because someone isn’t trying to scam you out of your hard-earned money doesn’t mean that they don’t see you as a pawn, stepping stone, or a means to an end. Find out how to protect yourself from a narcissist. Our guest today is Dr. Ramani Durvasula. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Ramani Durvasula is one of the world-leading experts on narcissism. She is a clinical psychologist, professor, best selling author, and speaker. She is on a mission to demystify and dismantle the toxic influence of narcissism on all of our lives. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Ramani shares her many experiences with working with narcissists. We talk about warning signs and risks for being in a relationship or working for a narcissist. We also talk about how to protect yourself if you are in a relationship or working with a narcissist.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[00:48] - Dr. Ramani shares how she got involved in psychology. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[02:55] - The fall out for the people that stay in relationships with narcissists with chronic invalidating was shredding. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[04:46] - Narcissism is a pattern of a person who lacks empathy, is deeply entitled, arrogant, superficial, and constantly needs validation. They fall apart under criticism or feedback. They get very vindictive or rageful and feel like victims a lot. There is a core self-esteem issue. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:34] - The chilling difference between narcissists and psychopaths is that narcissists do feel remorse. Psychopaths have very little if any remorse. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[07:03] - Psychopaths are much like some narcissists. They can be charming, intelligent, clever, charismatic, and very confident. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[08:17] - Sociopaths know the rules, but they still break them. They tend to be more combative and agitated. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[09:03] - Narcissists are insecure and do feel anxiety and remorse. The psychopath doesn’t feel any of those things. They are much calmer and calculated. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:12] - Narcissists give more warning signs because they are so sensitive to criticism of any kind. Psychopaths will lie and they are the ultimate con man. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:05] - Narcissists have huge advantages. They make more money and are more likely to end up in leadership positions. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:28] - Narcissists are motivated to get validation. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:48] - Narcissists win the most with social media because they love attention. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:44] - Narcissists are incredibly hypocritical. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:04] - Being in a relationship or working with a narcissist is very bad for your health. The risks include feeling chronically confused, feeling self-doubt, anxiety, depression, not sleeping, and more. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:45] - These people stay in these relationships because they don’t understand that narcissism doesn’t change. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:10] - Trauma, neglect, abuse, lack of consistency, and safety can lead to adult narcissism. The other pathway is a person that is over or under indulge. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:02] - At the surface level, narcissists are very engaging, charming, and confident. People are drawn to them. They also have a dismissiveness. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:14] - Narcissists are very entitled and believe that the rules don’t apply to them. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:40] - The key is having radical acceptance that they are not going to change and they are a jerk. Once you have radical acceptance you don’t personalize it. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:41] - Don’t try to fix it and don’t believe their false promises. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:10] - Don’t engage! There is nothing you can say to them without them getting angry. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:02] - Their ego is so threatened that they have to destroy everything in their way. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[31:01] - With a narcissist, a big part is figuring out what they need to have to feel like they have won. They want to hurt you, make you feel as bad as they do, and win. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[33:55] - At a population level, there are more male narcissists than female narcissists. There are still a lot of narcissistic women out there. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[36:22] - The expression of narcissism can look a little bit different based on gender. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[37:49] - The vast majority of scammers are psychopaths or narcissists.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[39:38] - These scammers play on people’s vulnerabilities, aspirations, and hope and show no empathy. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[41:54] - The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

They tend to be more combative and agitated. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[09:03] - Narcissists are insecure and do feel anxiety and remorse. The psychopath doesn’t feel any of those things. They are much calmer and calculated. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[10:12] - Narcissists give more warning signs because they are so sensitive to criticism of any kind. Psychopaths will lie and they are the ultimate con man. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[11:05] - Narcissists have huge advantages. They make more money and are more likely to end up in leadership positions. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[12:28] - Narcissists are motivated to get validation. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[14:48] - Narcissists win the most with social media because they love attention. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[16:44] - Narcissists are incredibly hypocritical. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[18:04] - Being in a relationship or working with a narcissist is very bad for your health. The risks include feeling chronically confused, feeling self-doubt, anxiety, depression, not sleeping, and more. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[18:45] - These people stay in these relationships because they don’t understand that narcissism doesn’t change. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[20:10] - Trauma, neglect, abuse, lack of consistency, and safety can lead to adult narcissism. The other pathway is a person that is over or under indulge. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[22:02] - At the surface level, narcissists are very engaging, charming, and confident. People are drawn to them. They also have a dismissiveness. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[23:14] - Narcissists are very entitled and believe that the rules don’t apply to them. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[24:40] - The key is having radical acceptance that they are not going to change and they are a jerk. Once you have radical acceptance you don’t personalize it. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[25:41] - Don’t try to fix it and don’t believe their false promises. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[27:10] - Don’t engage! There is nothing you can say to them without them getting angry. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[30:02] - Their ego is so threatened that they have to destroy everything in their way. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[31:01] - With a narcissist, a big part is figuring out what they need to have to feel like they have won. They want to hurt you, make you feel as bad as they do, and win. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[33:55] - At a population level, there are more male narcissists than female narcissists. There are still a lot of narcissistic women out there. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[36:22] - The expression of narcissism can look a little bit different based on gender. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[37:49] - The vast majority of scammers are psychopaths or narcissists.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[39:38] - These scammers play on people’s vulnerabilities, aspirations, and hope and show no empathy. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[41:54] - The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. </li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

He began as a scam baiter in 2005 before concentrating and helping the victims of scams. </span> <a href="https://scamsurvivors.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Scam Survivors</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">was created in 2012 by Wayne along with a small group of like-minded volunteers.

Then you can post the information online to warn other people.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:41] - It is important to get the scammer information out there so the public can find it.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[07:21] - Wayne isn’t seeing a lot of new scams.  Instead, he is seeing variations of old scams.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[08:07] - The first step in getting the site taken down is to get as much information as you can from the scammer.

You need their email address, not just their name.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:19] - The emails are often repeated because they are scripts.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:52] - People can do the same checks and searches they do at home.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:02] - One telltale sign is inconsistency in language or grammar.   </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:01] - As soon as anyone asks for money you know it is a scam.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:17] - He does not use cash baiting because you are not getting the scammers money you are actually getting some other victim’s money.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:38] - Wayne has a book called</span> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Stupid-Scammer-Files-collection-ridiculous/dp/B085RM9QR8"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Stupid Scammer Files</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">where he shares the stupid things that scammers say.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:31] - Wayne shares some examples of stupid things scammers have said.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:15] - If you get these emails, come to their website and post them to help other people that don’t realize it is a scam.  </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accounting doesn’t sound like a sexy career choice. How about forensic accounting and getting to work with the FBI and Secret Service? Now that’s getting interesting. White-collar crime is typically committed by business or government professionals that engage in fraud, insider trader, embezzlement, or cybercrime. It can destroy companies, individuals, and families. What happens when a murder occurs during these cases? </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Brody is a professor and chair of the accounting department at the Anderson School of Management at the University of New Mexico. He is a certified fraud examiner, certified public accountant, and a forensic certified public accountant. He serves as an expert witness and has experience in both civil and criminal cases. He has worked with the U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the New Mexico Attorney General’s office. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich shares many experiences working in white-collar and red-collar crime. We also discuss ways to help you be more knowledgeable because education is the only solution. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[01:14] - Rich shares the background on how he got started in white-collar crime. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[03:14] - He is very proud that he has been able to go out and speak to so many people about white-collar crime. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[03:57] - Trust no one until you can verify. Use the same standard for interacting online as you do in person. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:02] - White-collar crime includes occupational fraud, embezzlement, and more on the business side and scam artist, identity theft, and romance fraud on the individual side. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:59] - It’s not a small number of people that are doing this and it is a huge number of people that have been victimized.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[06:11] - It is highly profitable and fairly low risk. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[09:07] - Most people proceed by accepting it as an expensive lesson. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:12] - Filing a police report is an easy thing for a business to do. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:31] - In the area of identity theft, filing a police report will then give you the ability to get free services from the credit reporting agencies. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:10] - One of Rich’s goals is educating people.

Just because it seems like a suicide, it might not be. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:56] - Sometimes the violent act can actually be against yourself. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:48] - Anytime you have a white-collar crime, the person who is involved in that crime is a potential suicide candidate based on the embarrassment. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:41] - Now scammers are going on social media, collecting personal information, and using that to convince them the scam is a legitimate situation. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:21] - What is even scarier about the red-collar area is that the victim doesn’t have to be someone who profited from the situation or is involved in any way. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:53] - There is a misconception that white-collar criminals are not like violent criminals. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:13] - Anybody can become a victim of white-collar crime. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:28] - In the original case that motivated the term itself, the victim knew that something was going on. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:43] - Many red-collar criminals are psychopaths. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:06] - The fraud triangle has the three common elements of fraud. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:01] - Red-collar criminals view killing someone as just as viable as a solution as any other solution. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:51] - We have to deal with the white-collar aspect to prevent the red-collar aspect. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[33:15] - Rich views this as a service to try to educate people.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Accounting doesn’t sound like a sexy career choice. How about forensic accounting and getting to work with the FBI and Secret Service? Now that’s getting interesting. White-collar crime is typically committed by business or government professionals that engage in fraud, insider trader, embezzlement, or cybercrime. It can destroy companies, individuals, and families. What happens when a murder occurs during these cases? </p> <p>Richard Brody is a professor and chair of the accounting department at the Anderson School of Management at the University of New Mexico. He is a certified fraud examiner, certified public accountant, and a forensic certified public accountant. He serves as an expert witness and has experience in both civil and criminal cases. He has worked with the U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the New Mexico Attorney General’s office. </p> <p>Rich shares many experiences working in white-collar and red-collar crime. We also discuss ways to help you be more knowledgeable because education is the only solution. </p> Show Notes: <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[01:14] - Rich shares the background on how he got started in white-collar crime. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[03:14] - He is very proud that he has been able to go out and speak to so many people about white-collar crime. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[03:57] - Trust no one until you can verify. Use the same standard for interacting online as you do in person. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[05:02] - White-collar crime includes occupational fraud, embezzlement, and more on the business side and scam artist, identity theft, and romance fraud on the individual side. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[05:59] - It’s not a small number of people that are doing this and it is a huge number of people that have been victimized.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[06:11] - It is highly profitable and fairly low risk. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[09:07] - Most people proceed by accepting it as an expensive lesson. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[10:12] - Filing a police report is an easy thing for a business to do. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[10:31] - In the area of identity theft, filing a police report will then give you the ability to get free services from the credit reporting agencies. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[12:10] - One of Rich’s goals is educating people. It is all about prevention. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[13:38] - Without trust, you don’t have fraud. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[14:37] - White-collar crime is something that is considered to be a violation of trust, but it doesn’t involve any violence. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[16:19] - A red-collar criminal is a person who commits a violent and brutal act on a person when they expect that this person can expose their criminal behavior. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[19:01] - There are many cases where you have the sudden death of a crucial witness in a case.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever wondered what strange things a digital forensic investigator has to dig through? Listen to this episode to find out.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our guest for this episode is Jake Moore. Jake Moore is a cybersecurity specialist for ESET, Europe’s number one internet security and anti-virus company. Jake previously worked in the police force for 14 years investigating cybercrime in the Digital Forensics Unit and Cyber Crime Team in Dorset.  In 2016, he was asked to implement cybersecurity advisers in order to make local communities more aware of ever-increasing cybersecurity threats.    </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jake shares many experiences working in digital forensics and cybersecurity. We also discuss simple things you can do to keep cybercriminals away and social media accounts safe.  </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[01:05] - Jake shares the background on how he got started in cybersecurity. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[03:20] - Without an understanding of cybercrime and what they are doing there is a huge chance that these companies are going to end up losing millions of dollars down the line.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[03:57] - When Chris was in college he was very interested in crime scene investigation and he did a ride-along with a crime scene investigator.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[06:13] - Jake shares a story about a time he received a laptop as part of a murder investigation.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[08:37] - In the UK, they have a system for reporting all cybercrimes called Action Fraud. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[09:53] - Cybercrime and fraud are making up over 50% of crime in the UK.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:03] - Prevention is the best cure.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:31] - Use a password manager.  90% of people are using two or three passwords for everything.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:29] - Jake also suggests turning on two factor or multifactor identification.  Every social media and email account offers it.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:14] - If it hasn’t happened to them or their nearest and dearest then people think cybersecurity won’t happen to them.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:22] - Sometimes in scamming emails they include an old password that they acquired from a data breach.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:39] - Jake likes to make people aware that you can phish people’s information.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:04] - Even people with awareness tend to forget about things as soon as something amazing comes along.   </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:24] - Cybercriminals are very crafty and they are doing their homework. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:34] - They often feed their victims’ egos just enough to get them to bite.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:24] - Cybercriminals use urgency as one of the key factors.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:06] - The use of authority is another key factor.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:14] - Always backup your data.  This is a good practice for everyone and can be beneficial in many different circumstances.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:31] - It is important to have a local back-up and a cloud back-up.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:01] - Chris has two back-up cloud services and a rotating clone of his hard drive.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[34:15] - Chris shares a back-up story about a company that he worked for.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[35:19] - Some people learn the hard way and sometimes that is what it takes.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[36:46] - It is important to have a place to store your photos and just use your phone for recent photos. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[37:21] - If Jake’s 73-year-old mum can do it then anyone can.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[39:12] - Sometimes providing more information can almost backfire and trip people up.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[39:44] - Awareness and education have to go hand and hand. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[40:36] - The number one rule is never to click on any link in an email. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[41:02] - Jake’s best advice is to do one of the things they talked about today in the podcast. </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have always been curious as to why so many people fall for scams. What are some of the consistent elements that scammers use to hook us? In this episode, we find out. We talk about the different psychological tactics scammers use to successfully scam their victims. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our guest for this episode is Dr. Stacey Wood. Dr. Wood is a clinical neuropsychologist and full Professor of Psychology at Scripps College in Claremont, California. She is an expert on a number of issues related to neuropsychology including aging, decision making, and capacity issues. Dr. Wood also works on the frontline with fraud victims as a consulting neuropsychologist with Adult Protective Services on cases in Riverside and San Bernardino, California. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Wood shares her experiences working with scam victims including the psychological tactics she sees scammers using the most. We also discuss red flags and practical tips for helping and talking with parents and grandparents. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[01:01] - Dr. Wood shares how she got into the psychology aspect of scams and frauds. She has worked with older adults most of her career, and she loves that. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[03:43] - When you are interviewing scam victims you start to understand the complexity of these scams. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[04:05] - Dr. Wood goes on calls to interview scam victims and she works with the Elder Abuse Forensic team. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:59] - Scammers use very complex psychological tactics. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[07:48] - There are certain risk factors among older people that are more common. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[07:58] - A loss in the past year greatly increases the chance of fraud. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[08:07] - Cognitive impairment is a huge risk factor in older adults. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[08:54] - Scammers are like a virus. They change and mutate incredibly quickly. Scammers went from mailing solicitations to older people to phishing emails, robocalls, and now social media. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:06] - When someone suffers a loss it is a huge transition in their life. It can be a loss of a sounding board and create isolation. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:41] - Adult children should initiate conversations with their parents about money because the parents most likely won’t do that. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:08] - Dr. Wood suggests adding an adult child to a bank account just for monitoring purposes. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:58] - You have taken care of me and watched over me all these years, now I have to start thinking about laying the groundwork of taking care of you guys as you age. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:30] - Most decisions we make are more impulsive and automatic. We really don’t have the resources to dig into every small decision we make during the day. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:57] - When there is scarcity it causes consumers to act more quickly. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:12] - Dr. Wood recommends taking time out or finding a sounding board before making a decision. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:38] - Urgency, scarcity, and authority are all red flags to be watching out for.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:44] - Scammers use the fire hose approach. They target everyone and hope that certain consumers will be in an emotional state or be prime to respond to their solicitation. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:06] - There are three types of reactions by consumers. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:22] - If you are wary about an email at all just delete it. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:48] - Scammers don’t care who they cheat. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:54] - When someone is scammed they are often terrified to tell anyone because they are in fear of how they would be perceived and how it would hurt their reputation. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[31:31] - Scammers often use the psychological tactic of always calling and always being in their life. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:01] - The bad guys only have to get it right once. The good guys have to get it right 100% of the time.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:44] - Having an open family dialogue about these issues is useful. Be more aware in these times of uncertainty. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[34:54] - Discussing your decisions with your parents may open the door to a broader discussion. It may help to foster a better conversation in general. </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever wondered how hackers find vulnerabilities and how companies can find and fix their own? You will find out today! On average 30,000 new websites are hacked every day.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our guest for this episode is James Kettle. James is the Director of Research at PortSwigger Web Security where he explores new ways to attack websites and designs and refines vulnerability detection techniques for the Burp Suites scanner. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James shares his hacking experience and hard work helping companies keep their websites secure from all the crazy stuff going on out there.  On today’s episode, James shares his expertise to help you be more aware of possible red flags and prevention measures to take to protect yourself and your website.</span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[00:40] - When James was at university he saw that Google said they would pay anybody that could hack their website. He thought that sounded like fun and spent a huge amount of time doing that. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[01:02] - Now James works at PortSwigger and researches new techniques to hack websites. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[01:11] - Bounty programs are where a company wants to make sure their product or website doesn’t get hacked by malicious people so they go out and publicly say that anyone is welcome to try and hack their website. If you are successful and you don’t do any damage, but you tell them how you did it they will pay you for it and then fix it. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[03:45] - Pen testing is the classic approach to securing your website where you pay a consultant to spend one or two weeks trying to hack your website. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:14] - It is totally worth it to get that third party view.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wondered how hackers find vulnerabilities and how companies can find and fix their own? You will find out today! On average 30,000 new websites are hacked every day.</p> <p>Our guest for this episode is James Kettle. James is the Director of Research at PortSwigger Web Security where he explores new ways to attack websites and designs and refines vulnerability detection techniques for the Burp Suites scanner. </p> <p>James shares his hacking experience and hard work helping companies keep their websites secure from all the crazy stuff going on out there.  On today’s episode, James shares his expertise to help you be more aware of possible red flags and prevention measures to take to protect yourself and your website.</p> Show Notes: <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[00:40] - When James was at university he saw that Google said they would pay anybody that could hack their website. He thought that sounded like fun and spent a huge amount of time doing that. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[01:02] - Now James works at PortSwigger and researches new techniques to hack websites. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[01:11] - Bounty programs are where a company wants to make sure their product or website doesn’t get hacked by malicious people so they go out and publicly say that anyone is welcome to try and hack their website. If you are successful and you don’t do any damage, but you tell them how you did it they will pay you for it and then fix it. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[03:45] - Pen testing is the classic approach to securing your website where you pay a consultant to spend one or two weeks trying to hack your website. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[05:14] - It is totally worth it to get that third party view. Developers often can’t find problems with their own products. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[06:13] - If you want to find a vulnerability on a website you need to use an attack technique.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[07:15] - These days they see a lot of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and it’s the most common one they see. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[07:37] - One of the most common causes of high impact breaches is access control issues.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[08:45] - James shares the biggest data breach they were able to do during their testing. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[10:31] - Try to use a framework whenever possible, because it makes things like sequel injection less likely to happen.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[11:01] - The standard approach after you make the website is to try to get someone else to look at it. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[11:27] - With Wordpress, it is very important to keep it up to date, install as few plug-ins as possible, and choose a good password. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[14:08] - Use as few browser extensions as possible to avoid possible malware issues. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[15:25] - Most people are not being personally targeted by hackers so the threats that most people need to watch out for are things that can be automated. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[16:10] - If you are using the same password on multiple websites you are going to get hacked. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[17:02] - A common misconception is that if you have a strong unique password then it doesn’t matter if you reuse it. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[18:03] - James uses websites with the assumption that all the data I give this website is going to end up public at some point. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[18:45] - Provide the minimum information possible. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[20:19] - James shares his all-time favorite story. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[22:33] - If an entity builds their security around detecting when people are attacking them then running a bug bounty would be harmful because they have no idea who is legitimate or hostile.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have probably heard of multi-level marketing also called MLM or network marketing. A multi-level marketing company is a company that recruits people to sell their products to their network including their friends and family. Network marketers typically buy inventory and then try to sell it. They can also recruit people underneath them and create a triangular shape in which they can collect commissions on the people underneath them who are also making sales.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casey Bond is a certified personal finance counselor and a lifestyle reporter for Huff Post covering money, home, and living. Her work has also appeared on Business Insider, Yahoo! Finance, MSN, The Motley Fool, U.S. News & World Report, Forbes, TheStreet, and more. Casey has been reporting on MLM’s for the past year. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big question many people wonder is if multi-level marketing is a great business opportunity or an opportunity to lose thousands. On today’s episode, Casey shares her expertise to help you make the decision that is right for you and help you beware of possible red flags. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[01:13] - A multi-level marketing company is a company that recruits people to sell their products to their friends and family and their network. It is also called network marketing or direct selling. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[01:29] - They typically buy inventory and then try to sell it. They can also recruit people underneath them and create a triangular shape in which they can collect commissions on the people underneath them who are also making sales. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[02:14] - You will find a wide range of products offered including everything from kitchen knives to insurance products. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[02:23] - Most multi-level marketing companies sell products that are traditionally marketed towards women. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[04:06] - These days the gig economy is huge. One-third of adults are involved in the gig economy somehow. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:02] - It is often presented as a way to make a ton of money in your spare time, and be able to win vacations, cars, and extra products. That is usually the case for a small percentage of people involved in MLM’s who usually got in very early and built a huge downline. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:41] - The key for being successful in an MLM is not necessarily making a lot of sales, but instead recruiting a lot of people underneath you. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[06:37] - A big red flag is having to buy your inventory upfront. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[08:10] - Another big red flag is when the initial details of this opportunity are vague or coming from someone you don’t know very well. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[09:40] - MLM’s really play into the emotional side of people who would really like to have something of their own and who would really like to become more financially independent. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:39] - The FTC watches and keeps an eye on the MLM industry. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:14] - Illegal pyramids schemes do operate legally until they are caught. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:50] - The Direct Selling Association oversees all MLM and direct selling companies. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:48] - Casey is very hesitant to recommend multi-level marketing to anyone because it is so easy to get in a hole with debt or overspending when there are so many other ways to make extra income. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:28] - It’s best to go out and create something for yourself instead of relying on an MLM. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:52] - The FTC does have an option on their website to report companies that are operating questionably. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:46] - Working for an MLM can put strains on relationships and friendships. </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workplace bullying and violence seldom happens in a vacuum but rather are led up to with warning signs and events. In this episode, I talk with Timothy Dimoff about workplace bullying and violence. Workplace bullying is usually not physical, but it is ongoing. We talk about steps you can take if you are a victim of workplace bullying and ways to prevent it from the very beginning. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timothy Dimoff is president of SACS Consulting and Investigative Services, a high-risk HR and security consulting and investigation firm. As a nationally recognized expert in high-risk security and human resources, he is a sought after consultant, speaker, media commentator, and expert witness. Timothy has more than 40 years of experience in law enforcement, corporate security, and consulting. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We talk about workplace bullying and violence and exactly what they are and the difference between the two. We specifically discuss what types of behaviors to look out for, things you can do to limit these behaviors, and how you can protect yourself from emotional and physical violence. Timothy shares steps you can take if you are a victim of workplace bullying or violence. </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[00:48] - Timothy’s first career was 20 years in law enforcement at an Akron, Ohio police department, and then the federal task force. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[02:04] - His career has been rewarding because he has been able to take everything he has been taught in both careers and apply it toward a positive. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[02:34] - The low-level workplace bullying is intimidation. People go out of their way to embarrass, intimidate, or degrade someone to get themselves to a higher level, promotion, or even just look better. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[03:21] - Higher-level workplace bullying is when somebody that really just has a higher level of anger or dislike for someone and they really want to go out of their way to damage them in some way. It could be physical, but a lot of times it is just mental or social. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[04:05] - You need to watch out for someone setting up and presenting you as somebody that you're not. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:18] - Human nature is simple. Where you get your reaction is where you continue and the severity increases. Try and downplay anything that happens especially in the beginning stages. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[06:50] - Bullying is defined by one major thing. It is an ongoing continuous off and on type of action. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[07:39] - You should be logging what is going on with the date, time, what they said, and what they did. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[09:47] - About a third of the accusations that happen they discover are false. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:27] - It is very difficult for companies to investigate these types of cases internally by themselves. Using an outside company sets the tone that this type of behavior will not be tolerated. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:49] - If the bullying goes unanswered by management it can turn into workplace violence. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:50] - Sometimes employers terminate an employee and get some pretty strong messages of aggression or potential retaliation. Once you have any kind of termination and there is an indication of these things you need to put some precautionary measures in place. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:02] - SACS has a threat response team that they deploy out to boost security, research the potential perpetrator, assess their level of anger and aggression, monitor them, and figure out how to track them and defuse them down. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:32] - As a society, we are showing more aggression as an answer to disagreements. Many people think that it is a proper reaction and they have a right to respond that way. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:23] - Sports, politics, and other types of events and debates can get very aggressive, mean, and attacking. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:48] - Timothy’s number one suggestion for any employee that feels uncomfortable or unsafe is logging the instances. That gets more effective results than anything else they can do. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:16] - What if it’s the owner of the company that is treating their employees this way?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:37] - If you are having problems with your direct supervisor then you take your complaints to the CFO, HR person, or another supervisor you respect and ask if they can help you. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:12] - Bullying is not just between employee and employee. A supervisor has a distinct advantage to use their level against an employee in the wrong way. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:05] - SACS Consulting works with both companies and individuals. Most companies call them to objectively find the truth. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:37] -SACS Consulting will work with companies if they want to find and live with the truth. </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Workplace bullying and violence seldom happens in a vacuum but rather are led up to with warning signs and events. In this episode, I talk with Timothy Dimoff about workplace bullying and violence. Workplace bullying is usually not physical, but it is ongoing. We talk about steps you can take if you are a victim of workplace bullying and ways to prevent it from the very beginning. </p> <p>Timothy Dimoff is president of SACS Consulting and Investigative Services, a high-risk HR and security consulting and investigation firm. As a nationally recognized expert in high-risk security and human resources, he is a sought after consultant, speaker, media commentator, and expert witness. Timothy has more than 40 years of experience in law enforcement, corporate security, and consulting. </p> <p>We talk about workplace bullying and violence and exactly what they are and the difference between the two. We specifically discuss what types of behaviors to look out for, things you can do to limit these behaviors, and how you can protect yourself from emotional and physical violence. Timothy shares steps you can take if you are a victim of workplace bullying or violence. </p> Show Notes: <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[00:48] - Timothy’s first career was 20 years in law enforcement at an Akron, Ohio police department, and then the federal task force. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[02:04] - His career has been rewarding because he has been able to take everything he has been taught in both careers and apply it toward a positive. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[02:34] - The low-level workplace bullying is intimidation.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because something is secure, doesn’t mean that it’s safe. The S in HTTPS doesn’t always mean safe. In this episode, I talk with Casey Crane about trust and encryption. We discussed many practical ways for you to avoid being a victim of a scam. Prevention and knowledge can help stop many attacks before they even begin. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casey Crane is a cybersecurity writer for Hashed Out at The SSL Store. Casey is a regular contributor to Hashed Out with 10+ years of experience in journalism and writing, including crime analysis and IT security. She also serves as a Content Marketer at The SSL Store. She has bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mass communications (in journalism and media studies) from the University of South Florida and USF St. Petersburg. Casey is passionate about data privacy and wants to educate others about encryption because it plays such an integral role in our daily lives (even though many people don’t know it!). </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We talk about trust and encryption and best practices for protecting you, your family, and your business. We specifically discuss what you need to look for before clicking on a link or downloading anything. We talk about different types of SSL certificates and how to figure out which one would be the best fit for your website. This episode will help you figure out if you need an SSL certificate and reputable and trusted sources that can help.  </span></p> <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Notes:</span></h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[00:35] - Casey works at the SSL Store as a content writer for the website and Hashed Out. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[01:17] - She wrote her master thesis on the relationship between serial killers and the media in terms of how they are represented. She has always had a keen interest in learning more about crime and criminal elements and it just transitioned over time into the realm of technology and cybersecurity. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[03:22] - What are HTTPS and SSL certificates?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[04:15] - HTTPS is an encrypted communication channel between one party to another. Passwords and personal information are encrypted. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:59] - Domain validated means that the person who requested the certificate gets an email. The email typically has a link or some files they need to upload to and that is about it. Organization and extended validation are two levels of validation above that. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[07:29] - The Anti-Phishing Working Group reported nearly three-quarters of websites that were phishing websites used an SSL or TSL certificate. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[08:21] - There are Unicode domains which basically pull from different languages, character, numerals, and signs. Those are now being used in web domains. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[09:25] - Criminals tend to go for the lowest hanging fruit. They want to make this as easy as possible for themselves to save time and make the most profit or achieve their agenda quickest. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[09:50] - If you get an email before you actually click on anything check the header in the email and see who the email is coming from. Check that the email and name match. Often the email is off by one letter or digit.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:59] - Scams often create some sort of feeling of urgency, curiosity, fear, or concern so people are motivated to want to answer that email quickly by clicking on the link or calling a provided number. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:25] - From a website owner perspective or an admin perspective it is about knowing which certificate you should be putting on your site. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:02] - If you are collecting any financial information you should be using an OV certificate at minimum. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:48] - In countries where the internet service is less reputable or you are concerned about your government snooping on what you’re doing, having the encrypted communication channel between you and the website prevents the content that is going back and forth from being seen. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:57] - Sometimes an issue that people tend to run into is that they just forget to check their certificates. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:40] - The shorter the validation is for a certificate the more secure it is because there would be less time for a cybercriminal to be able to crack the encryption. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:14] - The current standard for validation is 2 years for public certificates. It is continually changing and will keep changing.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:16] - Certificate managers are programs that can help you manage the certificate and the life cycle of the certificate. There are different programs based on your preferences and needs. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:56] - When you are able to keep your certificates valid you are avoiding issues and downtime. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:09] - The actual encryption from certificate to certificate is the same. It is still the standard encryption that is provided. It is just the extra features that vary per certificate.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:45] - Where can people go to get an SSL certificate? What should they be looking at to decide what is right for them?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:36] - Find a reputable source and then figure out what level of validation you need for a certificate. Then you need to choose the functionality of the certificate. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:57] - You want to make sure to choose a warranty as well. </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

Prevention and knowledge can help stop many attacks before they even begin. </p> <p>Casey Crane is a cybersecurity writer for Hashed Out at The SSL Store. Casey is a regular contributor to Hashed Out with 10+ years of experience in journalism and writing, including crime analysis and IT security. She also serves as a Content Marketer at The SSL Store. She has bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mass communications (in journalism and media studies) from the University of South Florida and USF St. Petersburg. Casey is passionate about data privacy and wants to educate others about encryption because it plays such an integral role in our daily lives (even though many people don’t know it!). </p> <p>We talk about trust and encryption and best practices for protecting you, your family, and your business. We specifically discuss what you need to look for before clicking on a link or downloading anything. We talk about different types of SSL certificates and how to figure out which one would be the best fit for your website. This episode will help you figure out if you need an SSL certificate and reputable and trusted sources that can help.  </p> Show Notes: <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[00:35] - Casey works at the SSL Store as a content writer for the website and Hashed Out. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[01:17] - She wrote her master thesis on the relationship between serial killers and the media in terms of how they are represented. She has always had a keen interest in learning more about crime and criminal elements and it just transitioned over time into the realm of technology and cybersecurity. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[03:22] - What are HTTPS and SSL certificates?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[04:15] - HTTPS is an encrypted communication channel between one party to another. Passwords and personal information are encrypted. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[05:59] - Domain validated means that the person who requested the certificate gets an email. The email typically has a link or some files they need to upload to and that is about it. Organization and extended validation are two levels of validation above that. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[07:29] - The Anti-Phishing Working Group reported nearly three-quarters of websites that were phishing websites used an SSL or TSL certificate. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[08:21] - There are Unicode domains which basically pull from different languages, character, numerals, and signs. Those are now being used in web domains. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[09:25] - Criminals tend to go for the lowest hanging fruit. They want to make this as easy as possible for themselves to save time and make the most profit or achieve their agenda quickest. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[09:50] - If you get an email before you actually click on anything check the header in the email and see who the email is coming from. Check that the email and name match. Often the email is off by one letter or digit.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[12:59] - Scams often create some sort of feeling of urgency, curiosity, fear, or concern so people are motivated to want to answer that email quickly by clicking on the link or calling a provided number. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[14:25] - From a website owner perspective or an admin perspective it is about knowing which certificate you should be putting on your site. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[15:02] - If you are collecting any financial information you should be using an OV certificate at minimum. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[16:48] - In countries where the internet service is less reputable or you are concerned about your government snooping on what you’re doing, having the encrypted communication channel between you and the website prevents the content that is going back and forth from being seen. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[17:57] - Sometimes an issue that people tend to run into is that they just forget to check their certificates. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[20:40] - The shorter the validation is for a certificate the more secure it is because there would be less time for a cybercriminal to be able to crack the encryption. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[22:14] - The current standard for validation is 2 years for public certificates. It is continually changing and will keep changing.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[23:16] - Certificate managers are programs that can help you manage the certificate and the life cycle of the certificate. There are different programs based on your preferences and needs. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[24:56] - When you are able to keep your certificates valid you are avoiding issues and downtime. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[27:09] - The actual encryption from certificate to certificate is the same. It is still the standard encryption that is provided. It is just the extra features that vary per certificate.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[28:45] - Where can people go to get an SSL certificate? What should they be looking at to decide what is right for them?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[29:36] - Find a reputable source and then figure out what level of validation you need for a certificate. Then you need to choose the functionality of the certificate. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[30:57] - You want to make sure to choose a warranty as well. </li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School districts, health care organizations, cities, and towns have all been victims of ransomware. Families have lost access to photo albums of 20 years of memories and personal finances. It can be a very devastating experience. It is very scary to not be able to do your job or access your data.  Now attackers are not only threatening to delete your data, but they are also threatening to leak the data.  This can cause lawsuits, legal ramifications, and a huge headache for businesses large and small. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is ransomware?  Ransomware is a type of malware that gets installed on your machine and it locks all of your files so you can’t access them.  It spreads very quickly through your computer and you may be unable to access crucial programs and files.  Often you get a message from the attackers requesting money or your data will be leaked or deleted. Craig and Joel share their expert insights on how to prevent these attacks. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Craig MacAlpine is the founder and CEO of</span> <a href= "https://www.expertinsights.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Expert Insights</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">and a passionate security innovator with over 20 years of experience in information security and product management previously founding e-mail security company EPA Cloud. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel Witts is a Senior Content Editor at</span> <a href= "https://www.expertinsights.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Expert Insights</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">covering a multitude of areas including cybersecurity.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We talk about ransomware and best practices for protecting you, your family and your business.  We specifically discuss ways ransomware can get in, how you can be affected, and ways to protect against it.  We talk about secure gateway products, post-delivery protection, and isolation.  This episode will help you figure out what solution can offer the best protection to your family and business.  </span></p> <p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[01:38] - Ransomware is a type of malware that gets installed on your machine and it locks all of your files so you can’t access them.

The most common targets are healthcare, education, towns, and cities.   </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[07:19] - The average ransom sum is increasing to over $40,000. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[09:01] - There is conflicting advice on whether the company should pay the ransom or not.  There is no guarantee that you will get your data back.   </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[09:59] - Ransomware has become more of a well-known issue.  Businesses are putting more measures in place to try and mitigate the risks from these threats. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:10] - A common way for ransomware to start in an organization is through phishing attacks which are difficult to stop.  Phishing is a type of email that tries to trick a user into performing an action.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:31] - If you have got a savvy phisher whose updating that content it is really hard for the gateway systems to pick that up.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:14] - The email may be the start of the phish, but not the method that the malware is downloaded that is just where they start the conversation. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:03] - Secure gateway products usually do a good job stopping spam and phishing emails.

It will probably become less frequent, but never entirely go away. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[37:07] - The scammers only have to get it right once, but the people that are protecting against it have to get it right 100% of the time. There will always be an element of human mistake because of emotions and fear.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[39:46] - The attacks can be very effective because of fear and time sensitivity even if technologically we are able to stop them.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[40:28] - Great advice is to not panic if you get hit by ransomware.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><!--more--></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identity theft comes in many forms. Children and adults can be victims of identity theft.  Each year there are over 9 million identity victims.  1 million of these victims are minor children. The worst part is that we often don’t notice a problem until we need to buy a car, house, or get a college loan. The clean-up process can be costly and time-consuming.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dana Mantilia is the founder of</span> <a href= "https://www.identityprotectionplanning.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Identity Protection Planning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Dana grew up in the car business.  She was running and still oversees her family’s car dealership today.  In 2014 they wanted to open an insurance agency so they could offer insurance to their customers, and shortly after in 2017 she decided to get into the identity theft world and business. </span></p> <p><a href= "https://www.identityprotectionplanning.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Identity Protection Planning</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">helps Americans protect themselves, their family, and businesses from identity theft and cybercrime.</span> <a href= "https://www.identityprotectionplanning.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Identity Protection Planning</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was established to help educate, organize, and protect folks against identity theft. Her team established a user-friendly B2B software platform that allows agents, advisors, employers, and association managers to offer Identron identity theft protection plans to their clients, employees, or members.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We talk about identity theft, data breaches, and best practices for protecting you, your family, and your business.  Dana shares several practical tips and best practices that you can put in place today to help protect against identity theft. </span></p> <h3>Show Notes:</h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[00:32] - Dana shares how she got into the identity theft business.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[02:58] - Often with identity theft cases, you have to pay first to start the cleaning process. It can be expensive to start the process and maybe you will get some of that money back later.   </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[03:59] - What is identity theft? Identity theft is someone using someone’s social security number to get a loan, a job, get credit, or file taxes.  It often happens with children’s information. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:35] - The best thing to do with a child’s social security number is to freeze their credit.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[06:32] - Don’t give out your social security number or your child’s unless absolutely necessary. Be careful not to give your personal information out online.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[07:34] - Informed delivery with the post office is a great service to make sure all your mail actually makes it to you.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[08:18] - It is very important to have different passwords for different accounts. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[09:02] - Dana suggests getting a different email to associate with all financial accounts.  Use a password manager app with more complex passwords.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:15] - Stop doing Facebook quizzes.  Identity thieves actually create some of these quizzes.  They often ask questions to figure out security question answers. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:42] - Identity theft prevention service helps you with forms you need to fill out, government agencies you need to contact, and they help you along the process if your identity was stolen.   </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:45] - Keep close tabs and don’t give out your driver’s license number, medical insurance card, and birth date unless absolutely necessary.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:57] - Everybody should have either a fingerprint lock, gesture, or passcode on their phone because we are logged into most of our accounts.  If you lose that phone, they can change your passwords and log-in credentials.    </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:53] - Use two-factor identification is a great security measure to protect your accounts. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:18] - On Google and Apple phones, you can enable a service that allows you to remotely wipe your phone.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:33] - On your phone, you can see which apps have access to your photos, microphones, contacts, and location. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:57] - One time per year on each of the three different credit bureaus you can run your credit for free.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:33] - Identity theft protection services and insurance are a valuable service because it is something we are not good at and don’t want to spend the time doing those things if we can even remember to do them.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:57] - Most children are getting social security numbers right when they are born.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website attacks are very common.  They are often not personal, but they can create a mess for website operators.  As website owners and operators, we need website privacy and security especially if we are collecting data and personal information.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was making more money from my business in 2015,  the need for better performance became an issue.  I also needed to be able to keep my site up 24/7 and not have to deal with outages. My website started getting sustained 500-bit denial service attacks.  I realized very quickly that this was not my expertise, but that is when I began my partnership with Cloudflare.  </span></p> <p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">provides services that increase the security performance of over 26 million internet properties around the world from individual blogs to governments to Fortune 500 companies. </span> <a href= "https://www.cloudflare.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">offers services to accelerate internet applications and mobile experiences, mitigate DDoS attacks, prevent customer data breaches, stop malicious bot abuse, and more.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our guests on today’s show are John Graham and Evan Johnson. John Graham is a British software engineer and the current CTO at</span> <a href= "https://www.cloudflare.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">. Evan is a Product Security Manager at</span> <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We talk about attacks on websites, distributed denial of service attacks, and how to protect your own website.  If you want to keep your website up and running without skipping a beat, this is a must-listen episode. </span></p> <p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[00:58] - Chris is a</span> <a href= "https://www.cloudflare.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">customer and shares how he became a</span> <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">customer. He shares his history of working with</span> <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.    </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[03:05] - In 2015 Chris started getting sustained 500-bit denial services attacks. He realized it was not his expertise and he needed help with this.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[04:23] - John and Evan share the risks that</span> <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">helps website owners protect against.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:53] - What things should we worry about as website operators?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[07:09] - Evan is recommending businesses move more of their applications to the edge with workers with</span> <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare Workers</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.  It has real security benefits. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[08:29] - The big benefit of</span> <a href= "https://workers.cloudflare.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Cloudflare Workers</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">is that there is no back-end server to overwhelm.  It just moves the application to all of their servers.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:38] - Often hackers are using automated tools to scan websites, so you really want to limit the ability for that scanner to see something.  Then they will just move on.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:39] - Anyone that has a database should prepare for the contingency if you get your database breached.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Website attacks are very common.  They are often not personal, but they can create a mess for website operators.  As website owners and operators, we need website privacy and security especially if we are collecting data and personal information.  </p> <p>As I was making more money from my business in 2015,  the need for better performance became an issue.  I also needed to be able to keep my site up 24/7 and not have to deal with outages. My website started getting sustained 500-bit denial service attacks.  I realized very quickly that this was not my expertise, but that is when I began my partnership with Cloudflare.  </p> <p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> provides services that increase the security performance of over 26 million internet properties around the world from individual blogs to governments to Fortune 500 companies.  <a href= "https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> offers services to accelerate internet applications and mobile experiences, mitigate DDoS attacks, prevent customer data breaches, stop malicious bot abuse, and more.  </p> <p>Our guests on today’s show are John Graham and Evan Johnson. John Graham is a British software engineer and the current CTO at <a href= "https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>. Evan is a Product Security Manager at <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>.  </p> <p>We talk about attacks on websites, distributed denial of service attacks, and how to protect your own website.  If you want to keep your website up and running without skipping a beat, this is a must-listen episode. </p> <p>Show Notes:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[00:58] - Chris is a <a href= "https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> customer and shares how he became a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> customer. He shares his history of working with <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>.    </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[03:05] - In 2015 Chris started getting sustained 500-bit denial services attacks. He realized it was not his expertise and he needed help with this.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[04:23] - John and Evan share the risks that <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> helps website owners protect against.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[05:53] - What things should we worry about as website operators?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[07:09] - Evan is recommending businesses move more of their applications to the edge with workers with <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a>.  It has real security benefits. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[08:29] - The big benefit of <a href= "https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a> is that there is no back-end server to overwhelm.  It just moves the application to all of their servers.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[10:38] - Often hackers are using automated tools to scan websites, so you really want to limit the ability for that scanner to see something.  Then they will just move on.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[11:39] - Anyone that has a database should prepare for the contingency if you get your database breached. Know your legal obligations in dealing with that especially if you are storing personally identifiable information.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[14:01] - With <a href= "https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>, you can identify a problem and have it blocked almost immediately.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[14:58] - It is really hard to patch your website fast enough.  So a WAF can give you some breathing room while you patch the back end systems.  Everyone should have a WAF, it is an extra layer that can really, really help. A WAF is a web application firewall.   </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[17:16] - If you are connected to the public internet and you provide a service or website <a href= "https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> can protect that.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[18:13] - Use a good password and have two-factor identification.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[21:11] - <a href= "https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a> is super flexible and easy to write since you use Javascript.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[21:46] - John shares how <a href= "https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> is able to offer free DDos services to their users.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[23:12] - <a href= "https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> believes that your data is your data.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your online identity is quickly becoming more crucial to your personal and professional success than in-person communications. But most of us don’t understand this digital Wild West and the dangers that lurk around every corner. Most of us are unaware of the digital breadcrumbs that we leave behind with every post, and how easy it is for a person with malicious intent to harm us. In her book,</span> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Catching-Catfishers-Pretenders-Predators-Perpetrators/dp/1601633076/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Catching the Catfishers</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and on today’s episode Tyler Cohen Wood teaches us how to protect ourselves and our families from online predators.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyler Cohen Wood is a cyber-authority with 20 years of highly technical experience at the Department of Defense. As a Cyber-, Intelligence, National Security Expert, three-time Author, and Public Speaker, Tyler is relied on for her wealth of knowledge and unique insights. Tyler served with the Defense Intelligence Agency as a Senior Intelligence Officer where she developed highly technical cyber-solutions and made recommendations significantly developing and changing critical cyber-policies and directives affecting current and future intelligence community programs. She has helped the White House, DoD, federal law enforcement and the intel community thwart many cyber threats to the USA. Tyler’s expertise has made her a frequent guest and writer for both national and local television, radio, print, and online media.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is catfishing?  What do parents need to do to protect their children online? What can you do in this uncertainty to protect yourself from cybersecurity issues?  In this information-packed episode, we answer all these questions and more.</span></p> <h3>Show Notes:</h3> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[01:02] - When Tyler first started her cybersecurity career, she was doing digital forensics for The Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[03:01] - Parents often post pictures of kids and information without privacy settings.  This can put kids in potential danger.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[03:57] - Catfishing is someone pretending to be someone they're not in order to get you to do something or to give them information.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:31] - In most catfishing cases there are some monetary or other things they are actually looking for.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[07:30] - These attacks are always based on some fear or urgency. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[09:55] - It is really concerning that kids are being targeted now more than ever. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:35] - Predators target kids through online gaming platforms and social media apps.  It is so important for parents to really know what their kids are doing, who they are talking to and what accounts they have. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:05] - It is good to talk with your kids and sit with them and see what they are doing.   </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:36] - What do parents need to do to protect their children online?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[12:35] - Make sure you have accounts on all the same platforms that your kids do.  Often predators will start a conversation on Instagram and then move to an encrypted platform like TikTok, WeChat or WhatsApp.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:43] - Once a predator has a target they will continue to go after that target.  If they see someone that they consider “easy prey” they are going to go after that.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:58] - One of the number one things you should be watching out for is if someone claims to be somebody, but they don’t have an online presence normal for that person.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:15] - A Home Incident Response Plan involves talking with your kids about what to do if you have problems online including downloading malware.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:06] - In a Home Incident Response Plan you want to include a paper copy of all of the numbers of people that you would need to call in the event of identity theft or other emergency and all of your accounts. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:53] - If your friend sends you something that seems out of character or they’re using words that they don’t typically use that is an indication of a potential scam.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:12] - If anyone ever asks you for money on the spot just walk away.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:52] - Be really cognizant of what’s in the background of your photos.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:37] - You want to see what apps on your phone have access to.  They may have access to your microphone, video, or contacts. If they don’t need it then turn it off.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[28:12] - Fear, uncertainty, doubt, and urgency really get people in trouble.  Stop and take a breath before you react. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:26] - You have to take time right now to nurture yourself.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:08] - It is important to talk to our kids about what’s going on in the world right now.   </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[34:01] - Just be aware of what you're posting and what you’re doing and trying to be as paranoid as your be without being crazy paranoid. </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

What do parents need to do to protect their children online? What can you do in this uncertainty to protect yourself from cybersecurity issues?  In this information-packed episode, we answer all these questions and more.</p> Show Notes: <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[01:02] - When Tyler first started her cybersecurity career, she was doing digital forensics for The Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[03:01] - Parents often post pictures of kids and information without privacy settings.  This can put kids in potential danger.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[03:57] - Catfishing is someone pretending to be someone they're not in order to get you to do something or to give them information.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[05:31] - In most catfishing cases there are some monetary or other things they are actually looking for.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[07:30] - These attacks are always based on some fear or urgency. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[09:55] - It is really concerning that kids are being targeted now more than ever. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[10:35] - Predators target kids through online gaming platforms and social media apps.  It is so important for parents to really know what their kids are doing, who they are talking to and what accounts they have. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[11:05] - It is good to talk with your kids and sit with them and see what they are doing.   </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[11:36] - What do parents need to do to protect their children online?</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[12:35] - Make sure you have accounts on all the same platforms that your kids do.  Often predators will start a conversation on Instagram and then move to an encrypted platform like TikTok, WeChat or WhatsApp.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[13:43] - Once a predator has a target they will continue to go after that target.  If they see someone that they consider “easy prey” they are going to go after that.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[14:58] - One of the number one things you should be watching out for is if someone claims to be somebody, but they don’t have an online presence normal for that person.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[17:15] - A Home Incident Response Plan involves talking with your kids about what to do if you have problems online including downloading malware.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[19:06] - In a Home Incident Response Plan you want to include a paper copy of all of the numbers of people that you would need to call in the event of identity theft or other emergency and all of your accounts. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[21:53] - If your friend sends you something that seems out of character or they’re using words that they don’t typically use that is an indication of a potential scam.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[22:12] - If anyone ever asks you for money on the spot just walk away.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[24:52] - Be really cognizant of what’s in the background of your photos.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[26:37] - You want to see what apps on your phone have access to.  They may have access to your microphone, video, or contacts. If they don’t need it then turn it off.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[28:12] - Fear, uncertainty, doubt, and urgency really get people in trouble.  Stop and take a breath before you react. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[30:26] - You have to take time right now to nurture yourself.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[32:08] - It is important to talk to our kids about what’s going on in the world right now.   </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[34:01] - Just be aware of what you're posting and what you’re doing and trying to be as paranoid as your be without being crazy paranoid. </li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With over ten million cyber-attacks reported daily, we have to be equipped with the knowledge, information, and software to protect ourselves and our families. With the outbreak of the Coronavirus, there was a sudden shift of employees working at home and this has become even more of a problem. Since time wasn’t available for most businesses to create a well-thought-out plan, that opens the door for even more cyberattacks. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, Dr. Eric Cole and I talk about specific ways to make cyberspace a safe place to live and work. We talk about how to lock down your wireless access point, specific ways you need to update your computer, and most importantly how can you prevent these attacks. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">World-Renowned Cybersecurity Expert with more than 30 years of network security experience, Dr. Eric Cole is a distinguished cybersecurity expert and keynote speaker who helps organizations curtail the risk of cyber threats. Many of the foundational principles of this course and training in cybersecurity were developed by Dr. Cole. He has worked with a variety of clients ranging from Fortune 50 companies to top international banks, to the CIA, for which he was a professional hacker.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he started his career on the offense, he is now fully dedicated to understanding the adversary so he can provide cost-effective solutions that actually work. As a pioneer in the area of cybersecurity, he has been inducted into the Infosec hall of Fame, awarded the Cyber Wingman Award from the US Air Force, received multiple accommodations from the CIA and was part of the commission on cybersecurity for President Obama. He has been the featured speaker at many security events and also has been interviewed by several chief media outlets such as CNN, CBS News, FOX News and 60 Minutes.</span></p> <p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[01:41] - Most businesses when they are making decisions usually look at the benefits and security risks. With everything happening so quickly right now it is just survival mode. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[02:15] - It is dangerous to get people up in running without a security plan because people assume that their home network is secure and protected, but often it is not. Most people were never meant to run their business off their home network. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[02:39] - The first step is to lock down your wireless access point. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[04:27] - If you are going to be clicking on links or opening email attachments about Corna or anything emotional use an Android, iPhone, or IPad. Don’t use Windows for doing that web surfing and email right now. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:03] - If you are running a business you need to pay for the commercial file storage. Free isn’t free. The free accounts are a higher risk to your business. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[06:24] - Search for directions to update your specific router and you will find easy to follow directions for your exact router. In less than 10 minutes your now in a much better position and much safer than you were ten minutes prior. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[07:13] - When it comes to cybersecurity you are going to pay the pipe. You either pay now or pay later. Do you want to spend 10 minutes now patching, locking down and updating your router or do you want to wait for 2-3 months when your data and identity are stolen and then you have to spend 300 hours trying to clean and fix everything?</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[09:24] - Make sure your password to log-in to your wi-fi is different than your administrative password. In the last 3-4 weeks, there has been an increase in cybercrime. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:10] - What people don’t realize is that free is not free. They are using your data. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:01] - If the service is really free and the company is staying in business there have to be some exposure points they are not telling people about.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:01] - No matter what somebody says or does never give away that second factor in your two-factor identification. Eric highly suggests account monitoring over two-factor identification. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:44] - Prevention is ideal, detection is a must. Set up account notifications so if someone is logging into your account or even attempting to log in you will get a text notification.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:24] - If you catch fraudulent bank activity within 24 hours it is usually reversible. Turn on your notifications so if something weird is going on with your account you will be notified immediately and can take action. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:33] - If you get a call from your bank saying there is a problem with your account, tell them you are going to hang up and call them back. If they start making excuses you should know there is a problem. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:00] - If you get an email that has an emotional response, urgency, and something feels a little off or unusual pick up the phone and verify it. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:44] - When working at home paranoia is your friend. Trust no one, admit nothing and make counter-accusations. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:21] - Make sure all software, operating systems and anything you are running is up to date. Check your support pieces like Adobe and Java. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:49] - When using Zoom or online teleconferencing programs set the additional passcode every time you do a conference meeting. You should also review everyone on the call. If there is an attendee you do not know you can knock them out of the call.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:17] - When taking a picture of your workspace, be conscious of what people can see on your screen and in the background. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:16] - Assume that your video camera is on and always dress appropriately for online videos. </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this day and age, we are experiencing knowledge overload. There is information everywhere on the internet and social media. Add in the changes and hoaxes we are seeing pop up with the Coronavirus and it is harder than ever to decipher the truth. How do we research and check out this overload of information? In this episode, Alex and I talk about many strategies you can use to be more aware and make the best decisions for yourself and your family. </span></p> <p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Snopes.com</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">is a great resource for fact-checking information you receive.</span> <a href= "https://www.snopes.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Snopes.com</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">does the research, cites its sources, and encourages you to do your own research. Alex shares the history of</span> <a href="https://www.snopes.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Snopes.com</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">and how the mission and company have grown into the information giant it is today. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Kasprak is a science writer and investigative journalist at Snopes. Before joining Snopes, he wrote about science at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and at BuzzFeed. His work has been featured in The Atlantic, Motherboard, New Scientist, and other venues. These days, his work generally centers around scientific misinformation and long-term investigative projects. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex’s scientific background is in geological sciences. He has a master’s degree from Brown University, where his work focused on reconstructing environmental changes during a major mass extinction event by extracting molecular clues trapped in 200 million-year-old rocks. This research was published in the journal Geology in April 2015.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Alex has a master's degree in science writing from Johns Hopkins University. An adapted version of his Hopkins thesis essay was published online at The Atlantic under the title “The Desert Rock That Feeds the World” in November 2016.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When misinformation obscures the truth and readers don’t know what to trust,</span> <a href= "https://www.snopes.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Snopes.com</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">’s fact-checking and original, investigative reporting lights the way to evidence-based and contextualized analysis. We always document our sources so readers are empowered to do independent research and make up their own minds.</span></p> <p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[01:25] - Snopes has been around since 1994. It started as part of the Usenet Group dedicated to urban legends. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[01:39] - David Mikkelson and his wife Barbara spun it off into Snopes.com.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[02:04] - Now Snopes deals with social media misinformation, political stuff, and also investigative work. The mission and the size of the staff have grown over time. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[03:46] - Social media allows information to travel much faster than it used to through emails and other things. The tactics are always changing how misinformation gets around. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[04:40] - The most popular and most shared hoax on Snopes is the claim that posting something on your Facebook wall will legally prevent Facebook from using your material.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[06:39] - The underlying theme to most any conspiracy based hoax is that the government doesn’t want us to know this and is hiding it from us. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[08:52] - They often claim that the people debunking the myths are in cahoots with the people that are propagating the truth.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[09:22] - Hoaxes are designed to trick someone and are generally viral. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[09:53] - If a story feels too perfect for your personal or political viewpoints it is probably because someone is directly targeting you with that message. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:25] - The first thing to ask is does this seem too good to be true. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:20] - You can double-check most visual hoaxes by doing a reverse image search. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:49] - Different hoaxes target different demographics. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:53] - In general studies have suggested that older Americans are much more susceptible to online fake news than younger generations. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[15:46] - Political misinformation is typically targeted at making the other side look bad or your side look good. It doesn’t have a strong demographic component. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:46] - The motives for hoaxes can range anywhere from trying to be funny to financial motives. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[18:41] - Financial motives are the most common motivator for intentional misinformation. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[19:21] - Genuine innocent spreader heard something from somebody they thought was reliable and they shared it. It was wrong, but it went viral. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[22:08] - One outlandish hoax about the Coronavirus is the notion that holding your breath for 10 seconds can diagnose it. This is the most ridiculous scientific claim Alex has heard. It defies logic that that would be a scientific test. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:02] - Be careful of self-check and cure claims surrounding the Coronavirus. Another claim that sipping water every 15 minutes can cure the Coronavirus. Hydration is important, but you can not wash the virus down into your digestive tract to be destroyed. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[25:41] - When there are medical claims we have to be really careful not to follow the advice of people that are not physicians, doctors or people that don’t know our existing medical conditions and situations. Don’t take random advice. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:01] - Make sure to only read reputable sources like trusted news sources and governmental agencies. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[29:23] - In times of uncertainty we have to just take a step back, not share much, and accept the uncertainty and realize that if someone is reporting something with certainty at that time they are probably misinformed. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:01] With COVID-19 we are living in that uncertainty and doubt right now. Take a deep breath and don’t react out of haste. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:48] In crisis situations it is best to just not share information. Even a good intention to share information that comes without a named source doesn’t need to be shared and can often make the situation worse. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[31:20] Snopes.com is a credible news organization that you can check for information. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[32:44] Snopes suggests you take the argument they have presented and check it out for yourself. </span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the worldwide virus pandemic, we are seeing things on Facebook, Twitter and in our email multiple times a day already. We are focused on remaining vigilant so we don’t contract the virus, but we also need to become vigilant so that we don’t become victims of the various cons, schemes, and scams that are already starting to surface. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During uncertain times we often see scams on a personal level, business level, and national geopolitical level.  It is important to be informed so that we can be protected in all areas.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank Figliuzzi is the former Assistant Director for Counterintelligence at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Figliuzzi was previously the Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Cleveland Division which includes all of northern Ohio, and the major cities of Cleveland, Toledo, Youngstown, Akron, and Canton. Following his FBI service, Figliuzzi joined General Electric and served for five years as Assistant Chief Security Officer for investigations, insider threat, workplace violence prevention, and special event security for GE's 300,000 employees in 180 countries. Figliuzzi is currently a frequent National Security Contributor for NBC and MSNBC News.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A national pandemic is a target-rich opportunity for cons, schemes, and scams.  We have to make ourselves harder targets for the bad guys. It is really important that we don’t do things out of panic without researching, talking to people and seeking the right advice from the right people.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do we need to be looking for in an uncertain time to avoid being a victim of a scam or scheme?  Listen in as Frank and I discuss warning signs to look for and trusted resources you can turn in this very uncertain time.  </span></p> <p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[00:55] - We are all so squirrely focused on remaining vigilant so we don’t contract the virus, but I’m here with a slightly different message which is that we have got to become vigilant so that we don’t become victims during the virus of various cons, schemes, and scams that are already starting to surface. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[02:15] - When you see something that doesn’t look or sound right go ahead and research it, find out if it’s wrong, and if it is wrong politely post your research.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[02:52] - Frank puts these scams in three different buckets.  There are scams for coronavirus on the personal level, business level, and national and geopolitical level.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[04:01] - It is really important that we don’t do things out of panic without researching, talking to people and seeking the right advice from the right people.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[04:48] - We have got to look out for each other on this. If you have elderly family or neighbors we have to pay extra attention to them. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:36] - If it is too good to be true, it’s not true. Trust your gut! Run it by 2 or 3 other people that you trust.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[06:53] - When it comes to charities, Frank’s advice is to stick with the well-established charities that you already donate to. </span> <a href= "https://www.charitynavigator.org/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Charity Navigator</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">will do the vetting for you.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[8:13] - If anybody is asking for your money or your personal identifiers right up front the alarm bells should go off.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[9:58] - Many businesses are not equipped from a cybersecurity perspective to deal with work from home.   </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:34] - We are going to see a huge increase in accounts payable fraud. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:51] - Get your IT people together and pay now for the increased security or you’re going to pay later.  Maybe some sensitive functions should not be functioning at home.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:00] - Testing is a great thing to do before you launch into massive work from home. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[13:28] - If looking for work from home options watch out for the too good to be true.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the worldwide virus pandemic, we are seeing things on Facebook, Twitter and in our email multiple times a day already. We are focused on remaining vigilant so we don’t contract the virus, but we also need to become vigilant so that we don’t become victims of the various cons, schemes, and scams that are already starting to surface. </p> <p>During uncertain times we often see scams on a personal level, business level, and national geopolitical level.  It is important to be informed so that we can be protected in all areas.  </p> <p>Frank Figliuzzi is the former Assistant Director for Counterintelligence at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Figliuzzi was previously the Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Cleveland Division which includes all of northern Ohio, and the major cities of Cleveland, Toledo, Youngstown, Akron, and Canton. Following his FBI service, Figliuzzi joined General Electric and served for five years as Assistant Chief Security Officer for investigations, insider threat, workplace violence prevention, and special event security for GE's 300,000 employees in 180 countries. Figliuzzi is currently a frequent National Security Contributor for NBC and MSNBC News.</p> <p>A national pandemic is a target-rich opportunity for cons, schemes, and scams.  We have to make ourselves harder targets for the bad guys. It is really important that we don’t do things out of panic without researching, talking to people and seeking the right advice from the right people.  </p> <p>What do we need to be looking for in an uncertain time to avoid being a victim of a scam or scheme?  Listen in as Frank and I discuss warning signs to look for and trusted resources you can turn in this very uncertain time.  </p> <p>Show Notes:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[00:55] - We are all so squirrely focused on remaining vigilant so we don’t contract the virus, but I’m here with a slightly different message which is that we have got to become vigilant so that we don’t become victims during the virus of various cons, schemes, and scams that are already starting to surface. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[02:15] - When you see something that doesn’t look or sound right go ahead and research it, find out if it’s wrong, and if it is wrong politely post your research.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[02:52] - Frank puts these scams in three different buckets.  There are scams for coronavirus on the personal level, business level, and national and geopolitical level.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[04:01] - It is really important that we don’t do things out of panic without researching, talking to people and seeking the right advice from the right people.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[04:48] - We have got to look out for each other on this. If you have elderly family or neighbors we have to pay extra attention to them. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[05:36] - If it is too good to be true, it’s not true. Trust your gut! Run it by 2 or 3 other people that you trust.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[06:53] - When it comes to charities, Frank’s advice is to stick with the well-established charities that you already donate to.  <a href= "https://www.charitynavigator.org/">Charity Navigator</a> will do the vetting for you.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[8:13] - If anybody is asking for your money or your personal identifiers right up front the alarm bells should go off.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[9:58] - Many businesses are not equipped from a cybersecurity perspective to deal with work from home.   </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[10:34] - We are going to see a huge increase in accounts payable fraud. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[11:51] - Get your IT people together and pay now for the increased security or you’re going to pay later.  Maybe some sensitive functions should not be functioning at home.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[13:00] - Testing is a great thing to do before you launch into massive work from home. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[13:28] - If looking for work from home options watch out for the too good to be true.  Always check out the opportunities and do your research. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[15:16] - Test first before you start producing products remotely and make sure that it can’t be interfered with.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[17:03] - With the government stimulus package coming out we will likely see emails pop up asking for your social security, date of birth, and address which is identity fraud.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[18:31] - Don’t fall for people reaching out to you by phone, e-mail, and snail-mail.  Go to a government site for the information.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[19:26] - The government will not call you.  You can verify through their websites and the official numbers.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[19:38] - Share this information about possible scams with your grandparents, parents, and adult young children to protect them.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[20:56] - We are in a polarized society.  So far it has been political polarization. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[21:22] - The fear is that we will move from political polarization to polarized responses to a pandemic and that can be very dangerous. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[22:15] - There is also a foreign influence to try and polarize us.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[23:14] - Do not be afraid to block and report anything that comes across your screen that looks like it is dangerous propaganda.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[23:43] - When there is something really scary that we don’t understand, it is a lot easier to blame something that we can identify than to recognize there is nothing we can do about the situation and we just have to wait.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[24:15] - Humans want simple solutions to the scariest, most complicated problems.  We want to embrace the hopeful and simple.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[25:14] When you click on something that offers you that simple explanation or solution you are probably making a mistake.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[25:21] This is one of those situations where you have emotions, urgency, panic, health and fear on a worldwide scale all rolled up together.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of us love traveling, but safety and security are usually a concern in the back of our minds especially if we are traveling with our family.  So how do we stay safe and secure when we are traveling? J. teaches us what red flags to look for when reserving and staying with Airbnb. With a few extra steps any problem can often be prevented and in turn, keep you safer and more secure.  If you have thought about operating your own Airbnb tune in to find out what you need to be on the lookout for, how to be a responsive host and tools that J. offers to help you succeed.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massey is a full-time Real Estate Investor, Entrepreneur, Popular Podcast Host, Author, Speaker, Coach & All-Around Problem Solver. Cashflow Diary is a short-term rental hospitality training company. We show people how to build their own short-term rental business (without needing to buy or own any property) so they can thrive financially. Heralded as the most advanced short-term rental training in the industry, Cashflow Diary enjoys creating content and communities that are solely focused on developing individuals into powerful business owners. Founded by J. Massey, Cashflow Diary exists to create short-term rental entrepreneurs. No matter your passion, he believes that running a hospitality business will change people’s lives…</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to entering the sharing economy, J. taught real estate strategies based on his years of experience. He owned hundreds of units, raised tens of millions of dollars, and even owned cell phone towers. He was all but “retired” at the age of 38 when one of his students asked what he knew about short-term rentals – the answer at the time was, “not very much.” He started looking into the model and was astounded at the opportunities it presented. J. now runs a 34 unit short-term rental business, and they create more profit faster than any other strategy he has seen before. That means that you too will now have a business that creates more profits to invest into whatever is most important to you—your family, your business, your future, and your community.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line is that because short-term rental businesses provide a financial safety net, you can take more risks, develop advanced business skills, and do more of what you’re passionate about.</span></p> <p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[00:35] - Chris shares an</span> <a href= "https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43k7z3/nationwide-fake-host-scam-on-airbnb"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">article</span></a> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">from Allie Conti about her Airbnb problems and struggles. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[03:06] - As Allie digs into this particular host and their listings she finds out that this listing is actually being rented out by multiple people.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[04:18] - Common scams the renter is at risk of with Airbnb.</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[04:38] - If you don’t know what you don’t know you wouldn’t know that you have an opportunity to discover this ahead of time.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[05:05] - The number one concern of people is safety and security.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[06:59] - Message the host right after the check out time the day you plan to arrive so they have a chance to respond to your inquiry.  Tell them when you are planning to arrive and ask if everything will be ready for your arrival. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[07:37] - If you don’t get a response then you would call and involve Airbnb directly. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[10:00] - Usually if you contact the renter by 12:30 PM they will know if something needs to be replaced or if they need longer for a maintenance issue.   </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:09] - Hosts that are less communicative and responsive to their listings get pushed down in the search results.  Those who are more responsive are more likely to have their search results near the top.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[11:39] - Keep your conversations inside the Airbnb platform. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[14:20] - If the host needs to move you ask for a link to the listing.  It needs to be on the Airbnb platform that you made your original reservation on.  Then you can verify it with Airbnb.   </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[16:44] - Most plumbing issues can not be resolved in one day.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[17:39] - Every listing can have a unique cancellation policy.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[20:20] - On the operators’ side there is a predictable pattern to those who have less than honest intentions.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[21:33] - If the property is substantially different when you arrive, you have to document the differences with pictures and videos and contact Airbnb. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:08] - If you know your arrival time is late all these preventive measures are extremely important before the cutoff time which is usually around 10 PM. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[23:43] - Read the listings. Don’t just look at the photos.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[24:21] - If you are suspicious of a place take a screenshot of any of the photos and do a Google image search.  It will tell you if the image is used frequently.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[26:57] - The biggest abuse for operators is with pet situations, but often they could suggest a better location for you and your pet.  </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[27:56] - Hosts need to know how many people are actually staying on the property for safety and security purposes. </span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">[30:48] - Hosts know what bed bugs look like.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us love traveling, but safety and security are usually a concern in the back of our minds especially if we are traveling with our family.  So how do we stay safe and secure when we are traveling? J. teaches us what red flags to look for when reserving and staying with Airbnb. With a few extra steps any problem can often be prevented and in turn, keep you safer and more secure.  If you have thought about operating your own Airbnb tune in to find out what you need to be on the lookout for, how to be a responsive host and tools that J. offers to help you succeed.  </p> <p>Massey is a full-time Real Estate Investor, Entrepreneur, Popular Podcast Host, Author, Speaker, Coach & All-Around Problem Solver. Cashflow Diary is a short-term rental hospitality training company. We show people how to build their own short-term rental business (without needing to buy or own any property) so they can thrive financially. Heralded as the most advanced short-term rental training in the industry, Cashflow Diary enjoys creating content and communities that are solely focused on developing individuals into powerful business owners. Founded by J. Massey, Cashflow Diary exists to create short-term rental entrepreneurs. No matter your passion, he believes that running a hospitality business will change people’s lives…</p> <p>Prior to entering the sharing economy, J. taught real estate strategies based on his years of experience. He owned hundreds of units, raised tens of millions of dollars, and even owned cell phone towers. He was all but “retired” at the age of 38 when one of his students asked what he knew about short-term rentals – the answer at the time was, “not very much.” He started looking into the model and was astounded at the opportunities it presented. J. now runs a 34 unit short-term rental business, and they create more profit faster than any other strategy he has seen before. That means that you too will now have a business that creates more profits to invest into whatever is most important to you—your family, your business, your future, and your community.</p> <p>The bottom line is that because short-term rental businesses provide a financial safety net, you can take more risks, develop advanced business skills, and do more of what you’re passionate about.</p> <p>Show Notes:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[00:35] - Chris shares an <a href= "https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43k7z3/nationwide-fake-host-scam-on-airbnb"> article</a> from Allie Conti about her Airbnb problems and struggles. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[03:06] - As Allie digs into this particular host and their listings she finds out that this listing is actually being rented out by multiple people.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[04:18] - Common scams the renter is at risk of with Airbnb.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[04:38] - If you don’t know what you don’t know you wouldn’t know that you have an opportunity to discover this ahead of time.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[05:05] - The number one concern of people is safety and security.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[06:59] - Message the host right after the check out time the day you plan to arrive so they have a chance to respond to your inquiry.  Tell them when you are planning to arrive and ask if everything will be ready for your arrival. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[07:37] - If you don’t get a response then you would call and involve Airbnb directly. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[10:00] - Usually if you contact the renter by 12:30 PM they will know if something needs to be replaced or if they need longer for a maintenance issue.   </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[11:09] - Hosts that are less communicative and responsive to their listings get pushed down in the search results.  Those who are more responsive are more likely to have their search results near the top.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[11:39] - Keep your conversations inside the Airbnb platform. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[14:20] - If the host needs to move you ask for a link to the listing.  It needs to be on the Airbnb platform that you made your original reservation on.  Then you can verify it with Airbnb.   </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[16:44] - Most plumbing issues can not be resolved in one day.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[17:39] - Every listing can have a unique cancellation policy.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[20:20] - On the operators’ side there is a predictable pattern to those who have less than honest intentions.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[21:33] - If the property is substantially different when you arrive, you have to document the differences with pictures and videos and contact Airbnb. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[23:08] - If you know your arrival time is late all these preventive measures are extremely important before the cutoff time which is usually around 10 PM. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[23:43] - Read the listings. Don’t just look at the photos.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[24:21] - If you are suspicious of a place take a screenshot of any of the photos and do a Google image search.  It will tell you if the image is used frequently.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[26:57] - The biggest abuse for operators is with pet situations, but often they could suggest a better location for you and your pet.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[27:56] - Hosts need to know how many people are actually staying on the property for safety and security purposes. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[30:48] - Hosts know what bed bugs look like.  Renters will try to submit blurry photos of insects.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[33:39] - It is very common to say I couldn’t get in or I never stayed at a property.  Then the operator has to prove you stayed there with electronic door locks, key codes and other expert features.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[34:14] - If hosts know how to do proper screening checks on the front end most everything is preventable.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[37:02] - If you calculate the dollar per night per square foot of your hotel room, you will see how much you are paying for how little you are getting in exchange. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[37:31] When you choose to stay at a hotel you are choosing to eat out which is an additional cost. </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[38:04] With Airbnb properties you often have a full kitchen or at least a kitchenette.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[39:27] The demand for a different experience is high.  </li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">[40:11]  J. has a <a href= "https://cashflowdiary.outgrow.us/how-to-retire-on-airbnb-2"> tool</a> on his website to figure out how many units you need to have to retire. </li> </ul> <p>Thanks for joining us on Easy Prey.
